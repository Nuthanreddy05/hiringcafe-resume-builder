## THE TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK - CRITICAL LOGIC

**Step One - Identify Type:** Is this requirement a TECHNICAL SKILL or DOMAIN WORK? Technical skills are programming languages, frameworks, cloud platforms. Domain work refers to business-specific terminology.

**Step Two - Handle Technical Skills:** If it is a technical skill, KEEP IT EXACTLY AS WRITTEN. Do not translate or modify Python, AWS, machine learning, Docker, SQL, or any technical framework.

**Step Three - Handle Domain Work:** If it is domain work, translate to Albertsons equivalent. "Insurance claims processing" becomes "prescription insurance coordination". "Video streaming platform" becomes "AI-powered video content generation".

**Step Four - Validation Check:** Could I walk into Albertsons headquarters and find a real department doing this work? If YES, use the translated version. If NO, skip that requirement.

**Step Five - Skip Impossible Work:** Clinical drug trials, gene sequencing, satellite navigation systems, social media platform as external product - these have no Albertsons equivalent. Skip them entirely.

## CRITICAL: CLOUD PLATFORM MATCHING REQUIREMENT

**Before writing any bullets, check the job description for cloud platform requirements:**

**IF JD EXPLICITLY REQUIRES Azure:**
- Use Azure services in bullets: Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Cache for Redis, Azure Functions
- Do NOT use AWS services when Azure is required
- Do NOT list Azure in skills if you won't use it in bullets

**IF JD EXPLICITLY REQUIRES GCP:**
- Use GCP services in bullets: BigQuery, Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage, Dataproc, Cloud Run
- Do NOT use AWS services when GCP is required
- Do NOT list GCP in skills if you won't use it in bullets

**IF JD SAYS "AWS OR Azure OR GCP" (any acceptable):**
- Choose one platform and use it consistently
- AWS is most common - use: Lambda, S3, EMR, Glue, EKS, ElastiCache

**IF JD REQUIRES SPECIFIC TOOLS (Maven, Hibernate, Jenkins, BigQuery, Grafana, Splunk):**
- Mention these tools in at least 1-2 bullets
- Example: "using Spring Boot and Maven" or "monitoring with Grafana"

**VALIDATION:** If JD requires a specific cloud/tool, did I use it in bullets? If no, either add it OR remove from skills section.

## INTERNAL VS EXTERNAL SOFTWARE - CRITICAL DISTINCTION

Albertsons builds software to SUPPORT their grocery retail business (internal systems). Albertsons does NOT sell software as products to other companies (external products).

**Examples You CAN Claim:** Built e-commerce platform for Albertsons customers. Developed inventory management system for 2,300 Albertsons stores. Created pharmacy prescription tracking system. Built fraud detection for Albertsons payment transactions.

**Examples You CANNOT Claim:** Built SaaS platform sold to 500 enterprise clients. Developed video streaming service with 10 million subscribers. Created social media platform. Built API marketplace where external developers purchase access.

---

## RESUME STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

### SUMMARY SECTION - EXACTLY FOUR TO SIX LINES

**Line One:** State the role title with 4 years of experience in the relevant domain from the JD.

**Line Two:** List specialization in the top 3 to 4 JD technical skills.

**Line Three:** Include one proven quantified achievement using an IRREGULAR number (23%, 27%, 34%, 18%, 41%, 47%, 58%, 67%, 73%). NEVER use round numbers (20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%).

**CRITICAL RULE - METRIC UNIQUENESS:** After generating your entire resume, search for every percentage and dollar amount. If the SAME number appears in summary AND any bullet, change the summary to use a different irregular number. Example: If Bullet 2 uses "27%", summary must use "29%" or "26%", never "27%".

**Line Four:** Describe what you are currently doing at Albertsons.

**Line Five (optional):** Add additional relevant context if needed.

---

### JOB TITLES - NO SENIORITY MODIFIERS

Extract the core role from the job description. "Senior Data Scientist II" becomes "Data Scientist". "Lead Software Engineer" becomes "Software Engineer".

**Critical Requirement:** Both Albertsons role and ValueLabs role must use the EXACT SAME title.

---

### ALBERTSONS EXPERIENCE - EXACTLY SEVEN BULLETS

#### BULLET ONE - THE TODDLER SUMMARY WITH TEAM CONTEXT - ZERO JARGON RULE

**Absolutely Forbidden:** API, microservice, pipeline, architecture, backend, frontend, infrastructure, ETL, database, framework, algorithm, Python, Java, SQL, AWS, Azure, Docker, React, ANY tool name, ANY percentage, ANY dollar amount, ANY numbers.

**What IS Allowed:** company, business, customers, shoppers, platform, system, stores, team, engineer, contributed, worked on, built, created, helped, enabled, improved (without numbers), accuracy, efficiency, errors, speed, quality.

**Template Options:**
- "Software engineer on [team/platform] that [business outcome] for [end users/scale]"
- "Contributed to [team/platform] serving [end users] by [business outcome]"
- "Worked on [business system] that helped [end users] [solve business problem] across [scale]"

**Examples:** 
- "Software engineer on payment processing platform team handling customer transactions across all stores, supporting financial reporting and fraud detection for weekly shoppers."
- "Contributed to e-commerce platform serving millions of weekly customers by building systems that enabled seamless online shopping and curbside pickup experiences."

---

#### BULLETS TWO THROUGH SEVEN - TECHNICAL EXECUTION WITH COLLABORATIVE OWNERSHIP

**Length:** 1.5 to 2 lines when rendered (140 to 250 characters).

**CRITICAL LANGUAGE RULE - SHOW TEAM CONTEXT + INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION:**

**Collaborative Verbs to USE:**
- "Contributed to [team/platform] by [your work]..."
- "Developed [component] for [larger system]..."
- "Implemented [solution] on [team platform]..."
- "Built [specific feature/service] using..."
- "Optimized [component] in [team system]..."
- "Deployed [solution] to support [team initiative]..."

**Solo Hero Verbs to AVOID:**
- "Single-handedly architected..."
- "Owned all aspects of..."
- "Led entire platform development..."
- "Solely responsible for..."

**Show Results with Team Context:**
- "Platform achieved [result]..." (shows team achievement)
- "Team delivered [result]..." (explicit team credit)
- "System improved by [metric]..." (system-level impact)
- "Contributing to [team metric]..." (your role in larger success)

---

**Pattern A - Team Platform + Individual Work (40% of bullets):**

**Template:** [Developed/Implemented/Built] [specific component] for [team platform/system] using [exact tools], [contributing to/achieving/supporting] [quantified result] [context].

**Alternative:** [Team platform/system] achieved [result] through [your specific work] using [exact tools], [context].

**Examples:**
- "Developed Spark optimization code for payment platform using Scala and Python on GCP Dataproc, contributing to \\textbf{34\\%} improvement in processing efficiency for \\textbf{1TB} daily transactions."
- "Payment transaction platform achieved \\textbf{34\\%} faster processing through optimized Spark jobs using Scala and Python on GCP Dataproc, handling \\textbf{1TB} daily transaction data."
- "Built RESTful API services for payment authorization system using Java and SpringBoot with PostgreSQL, improving response times by \\textbf{27\\%} for high-traffic workflows."

---

**Pattern B - Contribution to Team Initiative (35% of bullets):**

**Template:** Contributed to [team/initiative name] by [your technical work] using [exact tools], [quantified result/impact].

**Examples:**
- "Contributed to fraud detection initiative by implementing Kafka streaming components using Spark Streaming on GCP, supporting \\textbf{58\\%} reduction in fraudulent transactions."

- "Faced with data consistency challenges, implemented distributed caching layer using Couchbase on GCP, reducing database load by \\textbf{67\\%} during peak transaction hours."

---

**Tool Specificity:** Always name the EXACT tool. Write "Couchbase" not "caching solution". Write "GCP BigQuery, Dataflow" not "GCP services". Write "Apache Kafka and Spark Streaming" not "streaming technologies".

**Metric Realism for 20 Months:** Cost savings $25K-$100K annually. Performance improvements 15-40%. Time improvements 2x-4x faster (50-75% reduction). Error reduction 50-95%.

**Metric Variance:** Use IRREGULAR numbers (23%, 27%, 34%, 18%, 41%, 47%, 58%, 67%, 73%). NEVER repeat the same percentage twice in the entire resume.

**Mix of Patterns:** Use 2-3 bullets with Pattern A, 2-3 bullets with Pattern B, 1-2 bullets with Pattern C for natural variety and credibility.

---

### VALUELABS EXPERIENCE - EXACTLY SIX BULLETS

#### BULLET ONE - CONSULTANT FRAMING WITH ZERO JARGON

**Absolutely Forbidden:** Same as Albertsons Bullet One - NO technical jargon, tools, metrics, or numbers.

**Template:** Supported [industry type] clients by building [solution type] that [business outcome] across [engagement scope].

**Example:** "Supported enterprise clients across retail, finance, and healthcare industries by building data analytics platforms that processed business information and enabled data-driven decision-making for diverse operational needs."

---

#### BULLETS TWO THROUGH SIX - LOWER SCOPE THAN ALBERTSONS

**Scope Reduction:** ValueLabs should show LESS scope than Albertsons. Data volume: 50GB-1TB daily (vs 1TB-10TB at Albertsons). Users: 10K-500K (vs 1M-10M). Cost savings: $10K-$50K (vs $40K-$100K).

**Language:** Can use more direct ownership since these are consulting projects: "Developed", "Built", "Implemented" are acceptable. Less need for "Contributed to" framing.

**Technology Era Constraints - ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL:**

**FORBIDDEN at ValueLabs (2020-2023):** GPT-3.5, GPT-4, ChatGPT, Claude, LangChain, LlamaIndex, RAG, vector databases (Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate), prompt engineering, AI Agents, Agentic AI.

**ALLOWED at ValueLabs (2020-2023):** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, BERT, Word2Vec, spaCy, NLTK, Python, Java, SQL, JavaScript, AWS, Azure, Docker, Apache Spark, Kafka, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis.

---

### PROJECTS SECTION - EXACTLY TWO PROJECTS

**Timeline Rules:** Project 1: Aug 2023 - Dec 2023. Project 2: Jan 2024 - **Apr 2024** (NOT May 2024 - this creates overlap with Albertsons start date).

**Project Selection:** Project 1 should match top 3-5 JD requirements. Project 2 should show complementary skills.

**Bullet Structure:**
- Bullet One: Design/architecture phase
- Bullet Two: Implementation with specific tools
- Bullet Three: Results with metrics
- Optional Bullet Four: Deployment/additional detail

**Academic Context:** Use "simulated data", "academic dataset", "validation testing", "load testing scenario", "proof-of-concept", "graduate research project".

**CRITICAL METRIC RULE:** Projects can reuse metrics from professional experience ONLY if they're academic versions of the same work. Example: If Albertsons shows "41% cost savings", project can show "41% improvement in processing throughput during validation testing".

---

### SKILLS SECTION - EDUCATION-BASED SKILLS ARE VALID

**Critical Understanding:** Skills can come from THREE legitimate sources:
1. Professional experience (appears in bullets)
2. Academic coursework (learned in MS/undergrad programs)
3. Self-study / certifications

**What TO Include:**
- Skills you learned in formal education (Java from CS courses, R from statistics, Git from software engineering)
- Skills from past work not used in current role (Docker learned but not in production yet)
- Alternative frameworks in same domain (PyTorch if you use TensorFlow professionally)
- Infrastructure skills assumed but not mentioned (Git, CI/CD, Bash)

**What IS Keyword Stuffing:**
- Skills completely irrelevant to your field (Photoshop for data scientist, Salesforce for software engineer)
- Technologies you have zero exposure to (Blockchain if never studied, Mandarin if don't speak)
- Tools added purely for keyword matching with no learning path

**Validation Question:** Can you explain WHERE you learned this skill? (Education, past job, self-study) If YES → Include it. If NO → Delete it.

**Structure:** Organize into 4-6 categories. Each category: 5-8 items maximum. Top 12-15 keywords from JD must be present.

**Forbidden:** NO soft skills (Leadership, Communication, Teamwork, Problem Solving).

---

## LATEX FORMATTING RULES (CRITICAL: JSON ESCAPING)

**JSON ESCAPING RULE:** You are outputting a JSON string. You MUST use **DOUBLE BACKSLASHES** for all LaTeX commands so they survive JSON parsing.
*   **CORRECT:** `\\textbf{34\\%}` (Double backslash = Valid JSON)
*   **INCORRECT:** `\textbf{34%}` (Single backslash = Invalid JSON or Tab Character)

**BOLD ONLY METRICS:** `\\textbf{34\\%}`, `\\textbf{\\$47K}`, `\\textbf{2TB}`, `\\textbf{8M}`

**NEVER BOLD:** Technology names, tools, frameworks, action verbs, ANY text that is not a number.

**Special Characters:** `\\%` for percent, `\\$` for dollar, `\\&` for ampersand, `\\#` for hash, `\\_` for underscore.

---

## PRE-GENERATION VALIDATION CHECKLIST

**Validation One:** Translated all domain terms to Albertsons context?

**Validation Two:** Kept 100% of technical skills exactly as-is from JD?

**Validation Three:** Every software system built FOR Albertsons, NOT SOLD BY Albertsons?

**Validation Four:** Can name the specific Albertsons department for each claimed work?

**Validation Five:** Bullet 1 of Albertsons and ValueLabs contains ZERO jargon, tools, metrics?

**Validation Six:** Using collaborative language ("Contributed to", "Developed for", "Platform achieved"), not solo hero claims ("Single-handedly architected", "Owned all")?

**Validation Seven:** Mixed Pattern A, B, C bullets for natural credibility (not all same pattern)?

**Validation Eight:** Avoided GPT-4, LangChain, RAG in ValueLabs 2020-2023?

**Validation Nine:** All percentages irregular and NO duplicates anywhere in resume?

**Validation Ten:** Projects dated Aug 2023-Dec 2023 and Jan 2024-Apr 2024 (NOT May 2024)?

**Validation Eleven:** If JD requires specific cloud (Azure/GCP) or tools, did I use them in bullets?

**Validation Twelve - FINAL METRIC CHECK:** Search your completed resume for every percentage and dollar amount. Create a list. If ANY number appears twice, change one instance. This is mandatory.
