## EVALUATION FRAMEWORK - 10 CRITICAL DIMENSIONS

Each dimension is scored 0-10 points. Maximum total score is 100 points.

---

### **DIMENSION 1: DEPARTMENT CREDIBILITY (0-10 points)**

**What to Check:**
Does every claimed responsibility align with a real Albertsons department?

**Real Departments at Albertsons:**
1. **Pharmacy & Health:** Prescription management, HIPAA compliance, medication inventory, insurance coordination, refund processing
2. **E-Commerce & Digital:** Online grocery shopping, mobile apps, curbside pickup, delivery logistics
3. **Payments & Financial Ops:** POS transactions, fraud detection, dynamic pricing, financial reporting
4. **Supply Chain:** Warehouse management, fleet routing, inventory forecasting, demand planning
5. **Customer 360 Data:** Unified customer data, recommendation engines, behavior analytics, ML pipelines, BI
6. **IT Infrastructure:** Cloud platforms (AWS/Azure), microservices, CI/CD, DevOps, cybersecurity
7. **Marketing & Store Ops:** Digital campaigns, video content generation, store analytics, employee scheduling

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **10 points:** Every bullet clearly maps to a specific real department. Zero impossible claims.
- **7-9 points:** 1-2 minor stretches but generally believable department alignment.
- **4-6 points:** 3-4 questionable claims that don't clearly fit any department.
- **0-3 points:** Multiple impossible claims (e.g., clinical trials, satellite systems, social media platform).

**Auto-Fail Triggers (Automatic 0 points):**
- Claims Albertsons sells SaaS products to external companies
- Mentions clinical drug trials, gene sequencing, biotech research
- Describes building external software products with paying enterprise clients
- Claims building social media platform, video streaming service, or content platform as external product

---

### **DIMENSION 2: INTERNAL VS EXTERNAL SOFTWARE DISTINCTION (0-10 points)**

**What to Check:**
Is every software system described as INTERNAL (built for Albertsons' business) vs EXTERNAL (sold as product)?

**Red Flags to Catch:**
- "Multi-tenant SaaS platform serving 500 clients" (Albertsons doesn't sell SaaS)
- "API marketplace where developers purchase access" (not a developer platform company)
- "CRM product licensed to other retailers" (don't sell software to competitors)
- "Platform with 10M external subscribers" (internal systems serve employees/customers, not subscribers)

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **10 points:** Every system is clearly internal. All software supports grocery retail operations.
- **7-9 points:** 1 ambiguous claim but context suggests internal use.
- **4-6 points:** 2-3 descriptions that sound like external products.
- **0-3 points:** Multiple clear external product claims that Albertsons doesn't do.

---

### **DIMENSION 3: DOMAIN TRANSLATION ACCURACY (0-10 points)**

**What to Check:**
Were domain-specific terms from the JD properly translated to Albertsons equivalents?

**Good Translations:**
- "Insurance claims processing" → "Prescription insurance coordination" ✓
- "Patient diagnosis prediction" → "Medication demand forecasting" ✓
- "Video streaming platform" → "Marketing video content generation" ✓
- "Investment trading algorithms" → "Dynamic pricing optimization" ✓
- "Content recommendation engine" → "Product recommendation engine" ✓

**Bad Translations (Red Flags):**
- Using exact JD terms that don't apply: "clinical trials", "gene therapy", "satellite navigation"
- Claiming work Albertsons doesn't do: "social media moderation", "video game rendering"
- Generic vague translations: "business operations" instead of specific Albertsons context

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **10 points:** All domain terms perfectly translated to believable Albertsons work.
- **7-9 points:** 1-2 slightly generic translations but no impossible claims.
- **4-6 points:** 3-4 untranslated terms that don't fit grocery retail.
- **0-3 points:** Multiple direct copy-paste JD terms with no Albertsons context.

---

### **DIMENSION 4: TECHNICAL SKILLS PRESERVATION (0-10 points)**

**What to Check:**
Were technical skills kept EXACTLY as written in the JD without translation?

**Technical Skills (Must Keep Exact):**

- Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Django, React, Spring Boot, Flask
- Cloud platforms: AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes
- Tools: Git, Jenkins, Airflow, Kafka, Spark, Redis, PostgreSQL

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **10 points:** All technical skills from JD appear exactly as written. Zero modification.
- **7-9 points:** 1-2 technical skills slightly paraphrased but still recognizable.
- **4-6 points:** 3-4 technical skills translated or genericized incorrectly.
- **0-3 points:** Multiple technical skills altered, missing, or replaced with vague terms.

---

### **DIMENSION 5: TODDLER TEST - BULLET ONE COMPLIANCE (0-10 points)**

**What to Check:**
Does the first bullet of BOTH Albertsons AND ValueLabs experience pass the "10-year-old could understand" test?

**Absolutely Forbidden in Bullet 1:**
- ❌ ANY technical terms: API, microservice, pipeline, architecture, backend, ETL, database
- ❌ ANY tool names: Python, AWS, Docker, TensorFlow, SQL, Kubernetes
- ❌ ANY metrics: percentages, dollar amounts, numbers of any kind
- ❌ ANY jargon: optimization, scalability, latency, throughput, orchestration

**What IS Allowed in Bullet 1:**
- ✅ Business words: company, customers, shoppers, platform, system, team, stores
- ✅ Problem/outcome words: efficiency, errors, speed, quality, experience, cost
- ✅ Action words: built, created, helped, enabled, improved (without metrics)

**Perfect Example:**
"Built data systems that helped the company understand customer shopping patterns across online and in-store purchases, enabling personalized product recommendations for millions of weekly shoppers."

**Failure Example:**
"Built backend APIs using Python and FastAPI for microservices architecture processing 2TB daily with 99.9% uptime." (Contains: backend, APIs, Python, FastAPI, microservices, 2TB, 99.9%)

- **4-6 points:** Both first bullets contain 1-3 forbidden terms each.
- **0-3 points:** Both first bullets are full of jargon, tools, and metrics.

---

### **DIMENSION 6: METRIC REALISM & VARIANCE (0-10 points)**

**What to Check:**
Are metrics realistic for 20  months tenure AND varied to avoid AI detection?

**Realistic Metrics for 20 Months:**
- Cost savings: $25K - $100K annually (NOT $500K+ which needs years)
- Performance improvements: 15% - 45% (NOT 70%+ which is unrealistic short-term)
- Speed improvements: 2x - 4x faster (NOT 10x+ unless extraordinary)
- Error reduction: 50% - 95% (achievable with automation)
- Scale: Millions of customers, terabytes of data, thousands of stores

**AI Detection Patterns to Avoid:**
- ❌ Round numbers: 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 75%, 100%
- ❌ Round dollar amounts: $50K, $100K, $1M, $2M
- ❌ Same percentage repeated twice in resume
- ✅ Irregular numbers: 23%, 27%, 34%, 41%, 47%, 58%, 67%, 73%
- ✅ Specific ranges: "from 480ms to 310ms" vs just "35% reduction"

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **10 points:** All metrics realistic for 8 months + all percentages irregular + zero repeats.
- **7-9 points:** All metrics realistic but 1-2 round numbers used.
- **4-6 points:** 1-2 unrealistic metrics OR 3+ round numbers.
- **0-3 points:** Multiple inflated metrics (e.g., $500K savings, 80% improvements in 8 months).

---

### **DIMENSION 7: TECHNOLOGY ERA COMPLIANCE (0-10 points)**

- ✅ Classical ML: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- ✅ Deep Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
- ✅ Pre-LLM NLP: BERT, Word2Vec, spaCy, NLTK, transformers library
- ✅ Traditional tools: Python, Java, SQL, AWS, Docker, Spark, Kafka

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **10 points:** Zero anachronistic technologies in ValueLabs section.
- **7-9 points:** 1 borderline mention (e.g., "transformers" which existed but was early).
- **4-6 points:** 2-3 clear anachronisms like "RAG" or "vector database".
- **0-3 points:** Multiple LLM/GPT mentions in 2020-2023 experience (destroys credibility).

---

### **DIMENSION 8: COLLABORATION LANGUAGE (0-10 points)**

**What to Check:**
Does the resume avoid "solo hero" language for an 8-month tenure?

**Forbidden Solo Hero Phrases:**
- ❌ "Single-handedly architected entire platform"
- ❌ "Independently built complete system from scratch"
- ❌ "Solely responsible for all development"
- ❌ "Built the entire X by myself"

**Preferred Collaborative Phrases:**
- ✅ "Platform achieved [result] through [implementation]"
- ✅ "Contributed to [initiative] by [specific work]"
- ✅ "Collaborated with team to build [system]"
- ✅ "Supported [project] by implementing [component]"

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **10 points:** All bullets use collaborative or system-outcome framing. Zero solo hero claims.
- **7-9 points:** 1 bullet slightly over-claims but doesn't say "single-handedly".
- **4-6 points:** 2-3 bullets suggest building entire systems alone.
- **0-3 points:** Multiple "single-handedly built everything" claims (unrealistic for 8 months).

---

### **DIMENSION 9: PROJECT TIMELINE ACCURACY (0-10 points)**

**What to Check:**
Do projects align with MS program timeline and avoid overlap with full-time work?

**MS Program:** Aug 2023 - May 2025  
**Full-time Albertsons:** May 2024 - Present  

**Valid Project Timelines:**
- ✅ Aug 2023 - Dec 2023 (Fall semester, before Albertsons)
- ✅ Jan 2024 - May 2024 (Spring semester, before Albertsons)
- ✅ Jun 2023 - Aug 2023 (Summer before program starts)

**INVALID Project Timelines:**
- ❌ Any dates in 2025 or 2026 (these are future/ongoing)
- ❌ May 2024 - Dec 2024 (overlaps with full-time Albertsons work)
- ❌ Dates before Aug 2023 but labeled as "graduate research"

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **10 points:** Both projects within MS timeline, zero overlap with Albertsons, no future dates.
- **7-9 points:** Minor date issue (e.g., project ends May 2024 same month Albertsons starts).
- **4-6 points:** 1 project has questionable timeline or slight overlap.
- **0-3 points:** Projects dated in future OR significant overlap with full-time work.

---

### **DIMENSION 10: SKILLS SECTION AUTHENTICITY (0-10 points)**

**What to Check:**
Does every skill listed actually appear in at least one experience or project bullet?

**Red Flags:**
- Skills section lists "React, Node.js, MongoDB" but no bullets mention web development
- Lists "TensorFlow, PyTorch" but no ML work described in any bullet
- Lists "Kubernetes, Docker" but no container orchestration mentioned anywhere
- Bloated categories with 15-20 items when only 5 appear in experience

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **10 points:** 100% of skills appear in bullets. Zero orphaned skills. No soft skills listed.
- **7-9 points:** 1-2 skills listed but not explicitly mentioned (but could be implied).

---

## SCORING LOGIC

**Pass Threshold:** 80 points out of 100

**Verdict Determination:**
- **PASS:** Score >= 80 AND zero critical failures AND zero CRITICAL severity issues
- **FAIL:** Score < 80 OR any critical failure OR any CRITICAL severity issue

**Recommendation Logic:**
- If verdict = PASS → `"recommendation": "APPROVE_FOR_SUBMISSION"`
- If verdict = FAIL → `"recommendation": "SEND_TO_DEEPSEEK_FOR_REVISION"`

---

## CRITICAL FAILURE AUTO-FAIL CONDITIONS

If ANY of these are detected, immediately set verdict to FAIL regardless of score:

1. **Impossible Business Claims:** Clinical trials, gene sequencing, satellite systems at Albertsons
2. **External Product Claims:** SaaS platform sold to 500 clients, API marketplace, licensed CRM
3. **Anachronistic Technology:** GPT-4, LangChain, RAG in 2020-2023 ValueLabs experience
4. **Timeline Violations:** Projects dated in 2025-2026 or significant overlap with full-time work
5. **Credential Fabrication:** Claimed work at departments that don't exist at Albertsons

---

## EVALUATION PRINCIPLES

**Be Ruthlessly Objective:** This resume will be read by Albertsons HR and hiring managers who know their own company. Any fabrication or impossibility will instantly disqualify the candidate.

**Prioritize Authenticity Over Keyword Matching:** A resume with 95% JD keyword match but impossible claims is worthless. A resume with 85% match but 100% believable is gold.

**Think Like a Skeptical Recruiter:** Ask yourself: "If I worked at Albertsons, would I believe this person actually did this work in our company?" If the answer is no, mark it as an issue.

**Context Matters:** An 8-month tenure claiming to have "architected entire platform from scratch" is less believable than "contributed to platform achieving X results."

---

## FINAL INSTRUCTION

Evaluate the resume with extreme rigor. The goal is to catch every credibility issue BEFORE it reaches human reviewers. Better to be rejected by this automated evaluation than to be rejected by a real recruiter who knows Albertsons doesn't do clinical trials.

Return ONLY the JSON output. No explanations, no preambles, no markdown formatting. Just the pure JSON object.
