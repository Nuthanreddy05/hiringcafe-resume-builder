    **FIRST BULLET (Per Job Experience):**
    - **Purpose:** "Toddler Summary" - Context setting for non-technical readers
    - **Rule:** Explain the role/project so anyone can understand (no industry knowledge needed)
    - **NO JARGON:** Avoid technical terms, acronyms, specific tools
    - **NO METRICS:** No percentages, dollar amounts, or numbers in this bullet
    - **Format:** "[Simple description of what team/project did] for [stakeholders] to [business goal]"
    - **Length:** 1-2 lines maximum
    - **Think:** What would you tell your grandmother about what you did?

    **Examples of GOOD Toddler Summaries:**
    ✅ "Supported retail operations team analyzing customer shopping patterns to help improve store performance across 2,000+ nationwide locations"
    ✅ "Built internal tools for marketing team to track how well advertising campaigns performed and measure customer engagement"

[16:00:05] Gemini EVALUATION Output
================================================================================
=== RESUME EVALUATION REPORT ===

**STATUS: ITERATE**
**TOTAL SCORE: 59/100**
**TIER: Needs Work**

---
### BREAKDOWN:

**1. ATS Keyword Match: 0/30**
- **Found (13):** Java, Spring Boot, React, Microservices architecture, RESTful APIs, AWS, PostgreSQL, Agile, Jira, GitHub, OOP, Software design patterns, Bootstrap.
- **Missing (2):** HTML/CSS/JavaScript/TypeScript, Debugging/IDEs.
- **Reason for Failure:** CRITICAL. The **Skills section is completely empty**. While 13 keywords were found in the project descriptions, an ATS will fail to parse them properly without a dedicated, categorized Skills section. This is an automatic disqualification.

**2. Toddler Summary: 0/20**
- **Role 1 (Albertsons):** FAIL - "No content provided. The experience section is empty."
- **Role 2 (ValueLabs):** FAIL - "No content provided. The experience section is empty."
- **Reason for Failure:** The entire professional experience section is blank. This is the most important part of the resume and its absence makes it impossible to evaluate.

**3. Authenticity Tone: 15/15**
- **Issues:** None. The verbs used ("Designed," "Built," "Implemented," "Developed") are strong, active, and sound like a skilled worker. No corporate fluff or passive voice was detected.

**4. XYZ Formula: 20/20**
- **Strong Bullets:** 8/8 (in Projects section)
- **Weak Bullets:** 0
- **Analysis:** The project bullets are exceptionally well-written, perfectly following the XYZ formula with clear results, actions, and tools. This demonstrates a strong ability to articulate impact, which must be applied to the missing Experience section.

**5. Metric Realism: 10/10**
- **Suspicious:** None. All quantified metrics (e.g., "30% improved response times," "23% improved system performance") are specific, contextualized, and believable for the scope of the projects described.

**6. Percentage Pop: 0/10**
- **Incorrect Bolding:** **AWS**, **Java**, **RESTful APIs**, **Spring Boot**, **CI/CD pipelines**, **GitHub Actions**, **React**, **Bootstrap**, **PostgreSQL**, **microservices architecture**, **OOP**, **software design patterns**, **Git**, **Jira**.
- **Reason for Failure:** The rule is to ONLY bold quantified metrics. The resume incorrectly bolds numerous technologies and concepts, which clutters the document and prevents key results from standing out during a 3-second scan.

**7. Historical Accuracy: 10/10**
- **Violations:** None. The technologies mentioned in the academic projects are appropriate for the 2023-2025 timeline. No anachronistic terms were found.

**8. Completeness: 4/5**
- **Missing:** The Skills section is not just uncategorized; it's entirely missing. This cost 1 point.

---
### VERDICT:

This resume is fundamentally incomplete and will be rejected instantly. While the project descriptions are exceptionally well-written and demonstrate high potential, the complete absence of professional experience and a skills section makes it non-viable. Furthermore, the summary claims "4+ years of experience," which is a severe mismatch for a "Lead" role requiring 10+ years, guaranteeing disqualification before the resume is even read.

---
### CRITICAL ISSUES (If ITERATE):

1.  **FATAL Experience Mismatch:** The JD explicitly requires **10 years of Java experience**. Your summary claims **"4+ years."** This is an immediate disqualification. You are applying for a role far senior to the experience level stated on your resume. This must be the first thing you address.
2.  **Empty Experience Section:** The `Albertsons` and `ValueLabs` roles are completely blank. This is the most critical content gap and makes the resume an empty shell.
3.  **Empty Skills Section:** The resume will fail 100% of ATS scans because the `Technical Skills` section is empty. All technologies mentioned in your experience and projects must be listed here.
4.  **Incorrect Bolding:** The visual scan fails because technologies are bolded instead of metrics. This makes the resume look unprofessional and difficult to skim for impact.

---
### PRIORITIZED FIXES:

**HIGH PRIORITY (Will gain 30+ points & prevent instant rejection):**

1.  **Align with Job or Find New Job:** You must either A) update your resume to truthfully reflect 10+ years of experience (if you have it) or B) apply for a Mid-Level role that matches your stated "4+ years" of experience.
2.  **Populate Experience Section:** Fill out the `Albertsons` and `ValueLabs` roles with 4-6 bullet points each, using the same high-quality XYZ formula you used in the projects section. The first bullet for each role must pass the "Toddler Summary Test."
3.  **Build the Skills Section:** Create a categorized list of your skills (e.g., Languages, Frameworks/Libraries, Cloud/DevOps, Databases, Tools) and ensure every technology from the JD that you know is listed there.

**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Will gain 10+ points):**

4.  **Fix Bolding:** Go through every bullet point and remove the bolding from all technologies, concepts, and verbs. **Only numbers, percentages, and dollar amounts should be bolded.** (e.g., `improved performance by **23%** using...`).

---
### ESTIMATED SCORE AFTER FIXES: 95/100

If you populate the missing sections with the same quality demonstrated in your projects and apply for a role that matches your experience level, this resume would transform from an instant rejection into a **Championship Level** document.

    *** RECRUITER-APPROVED BULLET STRUCTURE ***

    ### CRITICAL: Two-Tier Bullet System

    **FIRST BULLET (Per Job Experience):**
    - **Purpose:** "Toddler Summary" - Context setting for non-technical readers
    - **Rule:** Explain the role/project so anyone can understand (no industry knowledge needed)
    - **NO JARGON:** Avoid technical terms, acronyms, specific tools
    - **NO METRICS:** No percentages, dollar amounts, or numbers in this bullet
    - **Format:** "[Simple description of what team/project did] for [stakeholders] to [business goal]"
    - **Length:** 1-2 lines maximum
    - **Think:** What would you tell your grandmother about what you did?

    **Examples of GOOD Toddler Summaries:**
    ✅ "Supported retail operations team analyzing customer shopping patterns to help improve store performance across 2,000+ nationwide locations"
    ✅ "Built internal tools for marketing team to track how well advertising campaigns performed and measure customer engagement"

    **REMAINING BULLETS (Bullets 2-8 per job):**
    - **Purpose:** Achievement demonstration with measurable impact
    - **Format:** XYZ Formula (detailed below)
    - **Must include:** Specific tools, metrics, business impact
    - **Order:** Highest impact first (biggest $ or % at top)

    ### XYZ FORMULA (For Bullets 2-8):
    **Formula:** [Strong Active Verb] + [Specific Task/Tool] + [Quantified Result]
    **Structure Breakdown:**
    - **X (What):** Specific tool/skill used (Python, SQL, AWS, XGBoost, etc.)
    - **Y (Result):** Quantified metric (%, $, time, scale)
    - **Z (How):** Method or action taken

    **Examples of PERFECT XYZ Bullets:**
    ✅ "Reduced Snowflake query execution time by **28%** (from 45s to 32s) by optimizing complex SQL joins on **1TB+** daily transaction data, saving **$75K** annually in compute costs"
    ✅ "Built **Python** churn prediction model using **XGBoost** achieving **87% accuracy**, enabling proactive retention campaigns that reduced customer churn by **14%** (**$2M** revenue impact)"

    # STRATEGIC BOLDING (THE "SKIM READ" RULE):
    - **BOLD** only the **Metrics** (%, $, time) and **Key Technologies** (Python, AWS, SQL)
    - **Do NOT bold:** Verbs, generic words, company names

    # ACHIEVEMENT ORDERING (CRITICAL)
    **Within each job's bullets 2-8 (after toddler summary):**
    Order by IMPACT MAGNITUDE (descending):
    1. Bullet 2: Highest $ value OR highest % improvement ($2M > $75K > 28%)
    2. Bullet 3: Second highest impact
    3. Bullet 4...: Descending order

    # METRIC BOUNDARIES (STRICT REALISM)
    - Cost savings: $5K-$100K annually
    - Time/Efficiency: 10-30%
    - Revenue impact: $500K-$5M (only for clear business outcomes)
    - **RED FLAGS:** >40% improvement, "Architected entire platform", "Spearheaded", "Led team of 10+"
