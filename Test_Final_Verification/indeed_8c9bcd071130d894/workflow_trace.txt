    *** RECRUITER-APPROVED BULLET STRUCTURE ***

    ### CRITICAL: Two-Tier Bullet System

    **FIRST BULLET (Per Job Experience):**
    - **Purpose:** "Toddler Summary" - Context setting for non-technical readers
    - **Rule:** Explain the role/project so anyone can understand (no industry knowledge needed)
    - **NO JARGON:** Avoid technical terms, acronyms, specific tools
    - **NO METRICS:** No percentages, dollar amounts, or numbers in this bullet
    - **Format:** "[Simple description of what team/project did] for [stakeholders] to [business goal]"
    - **Length:** 1-2 lines maximum
    - **Think:** What would you tell your grandmother about what you did?

    **Examples of GOOD Toddler Summaries:**
    ✅ "Supported retail operations team analyzing customer shopping patterns to help improve store performance across 2,000+ nationwide locations"
    ✅ "Built internal tools for marketing team to track how well advertising campaigns performed and measure customer engagement"

    **REMAINING BULLETS (Bullets 2-8 per job):**
    - **Purpose:** Achievement demonstration with measurable impact
    - **Format:** XYZ Formula (detailed below)
    - **Must include:** Specific tools, metrics, business impact
    - **Order:** Highest impact first (biggest $ or % at top)

    ### XYZ FORMULA (For Bullets 2-8):
    **Formula:** [Strong Active Verb] + [Specific Task/Tool] + [Quantified Result]
    **Structure Breakdown:**
    - **X (What):** Specific tool/skill used (Python, SQL, AWS, XGBoost, etc.)
    - **Y (Result):** Quantified metric (%, $, time, scale)
    - **Z (How):** Method or action taken

    **Examples of PERFECT XYZ Bullets:**
    ✅ "Reduced Snowflake query execution time by **28%** (from 45s to 32s) by optimizing complex SQL joins on **1TB+** daily transaction data, saving **$75K** annually in compute costs"
    ✅ "Built **Python** churn prediction model using **XGBoost** achieving **87% accuracy**, enabling proactive retention campaigns that reduced customer churn by **14%** (**$2M** revenue impact)"

    # STRATEGIC BOLDING (THE "SKIM READ" RULE):
    - **BOLD** only the **Metrics** (%, $, time) and **Key Technologies** (Python, AWS, SQL)
    - **Do NOT bold:** Verbs, generic words, company names

    # ACHIEVEMENT ORDERING (CRITICAL)
    **Within each job's bullets 2-8 (after toddler summary):**
    Order by IMPACT MAGNITUDE (descending):
    1. Bullet 2: Highest $ value OR highest % improvement ($2M > $75K > 28%)
    2. Bullet 3: Second highest impact
    3. Bullet 4...: Descending order

    # METRIC BOUNDARIES (STRICT REALISM)
    - Cost savings: $5K-$100K annually
    - Time/Efficiency: 10-30%
    - Revenue impact: $500K-$5M (only for clear business outcomes)
    - **RED FLAGS:** >40% improvement, "Architected entire platform", "Spearheaded", "Led team of 10+"
