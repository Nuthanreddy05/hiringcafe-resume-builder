Scores have been calculated against this total and then normalized to the requested 100-point scale for the final decision.\n\nSTATUS: **ITERATE**\nTOTAL SCORE: **78/100**\nTIER: **Needs Work**\n\n---\n### BREAKDOWN:\n*Note: Scores below are raw scores based on the 120-point rubric.*\n\n**1. ATS Keyword Match: 16/30** \u26a0\ufe0f\n   - **Found (11):** TypeScript, React, NextJS, Web Technologies (via HTML, CSS, REST), Software Engineering, Enterprise Software, User Experience (UX), AI/LLMs, UI/UX Design, Performance, Security.\n   - **Missing (4):** Collaboration, Problem-solving, Customer Interaction, Mentoring.\n   - **Critical Deduction:** A score of 20/30 was earned for finding 11 keywords, but **4 points were deducted** because `User Experience (UX)`, `AI/LLMs`, `UI/UX Design`, and `Performance` appear in experience bullets but are **missing from the Technical Skills section**. This is a major ATS red flag.\n\n**2. Toddler Summary: 20/20** \u2b50\n   - **Role 1 (Albertsons):** PASS. \"Built and maintained the frontend systems for the company's online grocery store, helping millions of customers browse products, check real-time availability, and complete their shopping smoothly\" - *Perfect execution. Clear, non-technical, and focused on business value.*\n   - **Role 2 (ValueLabs):** PASS. \"Supported enterprise clients by building web applications that streamlined business workflows and improved operational efficiency across multiple industries\" - *Excellent. Establishes context without jargon.*\n\n**3. Authenticity Tone: 15/15** \u2b50\n   - **Issues:** None. The resume uses strong, active \"worker verbs\" (Built, Improved, Reduced, Accelerated, Optimized) and avoids corporate fluff or passive voice entirely.\n\n**4. XYZ Formula: 20/20** \u2b50\n   - **Strong Bullets:** 6/6 sampled bullets were perfect. They masterfully combine a quantified Result, a specific Action, and the Tools used.\n   - **Weak Bullets:** None found. This is championship-level content.\n\n**5. Metric Realism: 10/10** \u2705\n   - **Suspicious:** None. All metrics (e.g., 22% performance improvement, 19% defect reduction) are specific, believable, and well-contextualized for a software engineer with this experience level.\n\n**6. Percentage Pop: 0/10** \u274c\n   - **Incorrect Bolding:** **Critical failure.** Zero quantified metrics are bolded. The resume bolds job titles and headers instead. This makes the impressive results invisible during a 3-second human scan, defeating the purpose of quantifying them.\n\n**7. Historical Accuracy: 10/10** \u2705\n   - **Violations:** None. The technology stack listed for the 2020-2023 role (React, JS, SQL, ELK) is perfectly time-appropriate.\n\n**8. Completeness: 3/5** \u26a0\ufe0f\n   - **Missing:** The summary states \"**3+ years of experience**\". While technically accurate, the JD targets up to 4 years, and the candidate's experience is closer to 3.5 years. This undersells their qualifications. The rule specifically checks for \"4+ years\".\n\n---\n### VERDICT:\nThis is a classic case of **championship-level content packaged in a way that guarantees rejection.** The bullet points are exceptionally well-written, quantified, and believable. However, the resume is critically flawed in two key areas: it will struggle to pass aggressive ATS filters due to missing keywords in the skills section, and it completely fails the human visual scan by not making its impressive metrics stand out.\n\n---\n### CRITICAL ISSUES:\n\n1.  **ATS Optimization Failure:** The score of 16/30 is in the \"Borderline\" danger zone. Key concepts from the JD like `UX`, `AI/LLMs`, and `Performance Optimization` are mentioned in the resume body but are fatally absent from the dedicated **Technical Skills** section, which many ATS systems weigh heavily.\n2.  **Visual Scan Failure (Percentage Pop):** With a score of 0/10, the resume's best assets\u2014the metrics\u2014are completely hidden. A recruiter scanning for 3 seconds will see blocks of text and miss the **22%**, **19%**, and **28%** improvements that prove this candidate's value.\n3.  **Experience Undersold:** The summary's \"3+ years\" is a missed opportunity. Framing it as \"nearly 4 years\" or simply \"4 years\" would better align with the JD and the candidate's actual timeline.\n\n---\n### PRIORITIZED FIXES:\n\n**HIGH PRIORITY (Will gain 10+ points & pass screening):**\n-   **Fix Percentage Pop:** Go through every bullet point and bold **only** the quantified metrics (e.g., **22%**, **19%**, **$50K**, **15%**). This is the single most impactful change for human readers.\n-   **Fix ATS Keywords:** Update the `Technical Skills` section. Create a sub-category like `Practices & Methodologies` and add: `User Experience (UX)`, `UI/UX Design`, `Performance Optimization`, `Secure Coding`, `AI/LLM Integration`. This directly addresses the point deductions.\n\n**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Will gain 5-10 points):**\n-   **Update Experience Year:** Change \"3+ years of experience\" in the summary to \"**4 years of experience**\". The timeline (May 2020 - Present, with a gap) supports this rounding and aligns better with the target role.\n\n---\n### ESTIMATED SCORE AFTER FIXES: **92/100** (Championship Level)",

XYZ Formula: 15/20**\n    *   **Strong Bullets (5/6 sampled):** The majority of bullets perfectly combine a quantified result (X), a specific action (Y), and the tools/context (Z).\n    *   **Weak Bullets (1/6 sampled):**\n        *   `\"Built interactive data visualization dashboards using Chart.js and D3.js, enabling business stakeholders to track real-time inventory metrics and make data-driven decisions\"` - This bullet is missing a quantified result (X). While strong on action and tools, it lacks the impact metric present in others.\n\n**5. Metric Realism: 10/10**\n    *   **Suspicious:** None. All percentages (15-40%) are specific, believable for a frontend role, and grounded in realistic improvements (e.g., page load time reduction from 3.2s to 2.5s).\n\n**6. Percentage Pop: 5/10**\n    *   **Incorrect Bolding:**\n        *   `\\textbf{GPA:}` - The label \"GPA:\" is bolded, not the number.\n        *   `\\textbf{Relevant Coursework:}` - The entire label is bolded.\n        *   The rule is to only bold the metric itself (e.g., **3.8/4.0**) to make numbers pop for the human scanner.\n\n**7. Historical Accuracy: 10/10**\n    *   **Violations:** None. The pre-2023 role (ValueLabs) correctly avoids any anachronistic mentions of Generative AI/LLMs. AI/LLM experience is appropriately placed in a recent (2024) personal project.\n\n**8. Completeness: 5/5**\n    *   **Missing:** None.\n        *   [x] Summary states \"4 years of experience\".\n        *   [x] 2 projects with 3-5 bullets each are present.\n        *   [x] Skills section is cleanly organized by category.\n\n---\n**VERDICT:**\nThis is a championship-level resume that is exceptionally well-aligned with the job description and modern best practices. It will sail through ATS, immediately impress a human recruiter with its clarity and impact, and provides specific, believable proof of capability. The minor formatting issues are easily correctable and do not detract from its overall excellence.\n\n---\n**CRITICAL ISSUES (If ITERATE):**\n*N/A - This resume meets the \"READY FOR SUBMISSION\" threshold.*\n\n---\n**PRIORITIZED FIXES:**\nWhile not critical, these small fixes will elevate the resume from 90% to a near-perfect 100%.\n\n**HIGH PRIORITY (Will gain 5-10 points):**\n1.  **Strengthen Weak XYZ Bullet:** Add a quantifiable metric to the data visualization bullet in the Albertsons role.\n    *   **Example Fix:** \"Built interactive data visualization dashboards using Chart.js and D3.js, leading to a **10%** reduction in time spent on inventory analysis by business stakeholders.\"\n2.  **Correct Bolding:** In the Education section, change `\\textbf{GPA:}` to `GPA: \\textbf{3.8/4.0}` and remove the bolding from `Relevant Coursework:`. This improves visual scanning and adheres to the \"Percentage Pop\" rule.\n\n**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Will gain <5 points):**\n*   None.\n\n**LOW PRIORITY (Will gain <5 points):**\n*   None.\n\n---\n**ESTIMATED SCORE AFTER FIXES: 98/100**",
