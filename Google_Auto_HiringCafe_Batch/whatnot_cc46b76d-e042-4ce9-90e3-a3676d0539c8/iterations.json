The score is normalized to 100.*\n\n**1. ATS Keyword Match: 30/30**\n   - **Found (14/15):** Python, SQL, Machine Learning Frameworks, Search, Recommendations, Content Understanding, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Model Deployment, Software Development (concepts), Online Experimentation (A/B Testing), Feature Engineering, Docker, Kubernetes.\n   - **Missing (1/15):** \"Backend Implementation\" (minor gap, sufficiently covered by related terms).\n   - **Verdict:** Championship-level keyword optimization. Will pass any ATS.\n\n**2. Toddler Summary: 20/20**\n   - **Role 1 (Albertsons):** PASS - \"Built systems that help online shoppers discover relevant products and livestreams by understanding their interests and preferences\"\n   - **Role 2 (ValueLabs):** PASS - \"Supported enterprise clients by building machine learning systems that analyzed customer data to improve business outcomes across multiple industries\"\n   - **Verdict:** Perfect. Clear, concise, and business-focused.\n\n**3. Authenticity Tone: 15/15**\n   - **Issues:** None. The resume uses strong, active \"worker\" verbs (Built, Improved, Reduced, Developed) and avoids corporate fluff and passive voice.\n\n**4. XYZ Formula: 20/20**\n   - **Strong Bullets:** 6/6 sampled bullets were perfect.\n   - **Weak Bullets:** None found. Every bullet effectively combines a quantified result, a specific action, and the tools used.\n\n**5. Metric Realism: 10/10**\n   - **Suspicious:** None. All metrics (e.g., 22% accuracy improvement, 3x deployment time reduction) are ambitious but believable and well-supported by the context provided.\n\n**6. Percentage Pop: 0/10**\n   - **Incorrect Bolding:** The resume fails to bold any of the quantified metrics, significantly reducing scannability for a human reviewer. Key results do not \"pop\" off the page.\n\n**7. Historical Accuracy: 0/10**\n   - **Violations:** A critical, disqualifying error was found. The \"LLM-Powered Search Enhancement\" project is dated \"Aug 2024 \u2013 Present,\" which is in the future. This immediately destroys credibility.\n\n**8. Completeness: 3/5**\n   - **Missing:** The summary states \"3+ years of experience,\" but the job requires \"4+ years.\" This is a direct mismatch with a core requirement and will likely lead to rejection.\n\n---\n### VERDICT:\nThis resume is a paradox. The core content, language, and keyword optimization are in the top 1% of what I see. However, it is undermined by three critical, easily fixable errors that make it un-submittable. The future date is a credibility-destroying typo, the experience mismatch is a primary disqualifier, and the lack of bolding buries the fantastic results.\n\n---\n### CRITICAL ISSUES (Must-Fix Items):\n\n1.  **Time-Travel Violation:** The personal project date \"Aug 2024 \u2013 Present\" is impossible. This is the single most damaging error on the resume. It suggests a lack of attention to detail at best, and dishonesty at worst.\n2.  **Experience Mismatch:** The summary explicitly states \"3+ years of experience,\" while the job explicitly requires \"4+ years.\" This is an immediate red flag for any recruiter or hiring manager and may cause an instant rejection before the rest of the resume is even read. While you cannot invent experience, stating it this way guarantees you will be filtered out.\n3.  **Failed Scannability:** None of the excellent, quantified metrics (22%, 3x, 18%, etc.) are bolded. A human reviewer scanning for 3 seconds will not see any of your impressive results, defeating the purpose of quantifying them.\n\n---\n### PRIORITIZED FIXES:\n\n**HIGH PRIORITY (Will gain 23+ points and make resume submittable):**\n1.  **Correct the Project Date:** Change \"Aug 2024 \u2013 Present\" to a realistic past or current date (e.g., \"Jan 2024 \u2013 Present\"). This fixes the Historical Accuracy score from 0 to 10.\n2.  **Implement Bolding:** Go through every bullet and bold all quantified metrics (e.g., **22\\%**, **3x**, **18\\%**, **$50K**, **10M+**). This fixes the Percentage Pop score from 0 to 10.\n3.  **Address Experience Claim:** The \"3+ years\" is factually correct but doesn't meet the job requirement.\n    *   **Option A (Best):** Remove the \"3+ years\" sentence from the summary entirely. Let the dates in your experience section speak for themselves and try to pass the initial screen to a human who might be flexible on the 4-year requirement.\n    *   **Option B (Risky):** If you have other relevant experience (e.g., significant internships, research) that could arguably push you closer to 4 years, you could rephrase to \"Machine Learning Engineer with extensive experience...\" This is less precise but avoids the immediate disqualification.\n\n**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Will gain <5 points):**\n*   **Add \"Backend Implementation\" to Skills:** To achieve a perfect 15/15 keyword match, add this term to your \"Tools & Practices\" list.\n\n---\n### ESTIMATED SCORE AFTER FIXES: **98/100 (Championship Level)**",

ATS Keyword Match: 30/30**\n   - **Found (15/15):** Python, SQL, Machine Learning Frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn), Search, Recommendations, Content Understanding, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Deploying ML models at scale (Model Deployment, MLOps), Software Development (Backend Implementation, REST APIs), Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, A/B Testing, Feature Engineering. All keywords were also correctly listed in the Skills section.\n   - **Missing (0/15):** None. Perfect keyword alignment.\n\n**2. Toddler Summary: 20/20**\n   - **Role 1 (Albertsons):** PASS - \"Built systems that help online shoppers discover relevant products and livestreams by understanding their interests and preferences\"\n   - **Role 2 (ValueLabs):** PASS - \"Supported enterprise clients by building machine learning systems that analyzed customer data to improve business outcomes across multiple industries\"\n\n**3. Authenticity Tone: 15/15**\n   - **Issues:** None. The resume uses strong, active \"worker verbs\" (Built, Improved, Reduced, Developed) and contains zero fluff or passive voice. The tone is authentic and credible.\n\n**4. XYZ Formula: 20/20**\n   - **Strong Bullets:** 6/6 sampled bullets were perfect. They flawlessly combined a quantified Result, a specific Action with Tools, and clear Context.\n   - **Weak Bullets:** None found. Every bullet tells a complete and impactful story.\n\n**5. Metric Realism: 10/10**\n   - **Suspicious:** None. All metrics (e.g., 22% accuracy improvement, 3x deployment time reduction, 200ms to 50ms latency decrease) are specific, well-contextualized, and highly believable for this role and experience level.\n\n**6. Percentage Pop: 0/10**\n   - **Incorrect Bolding:** A critical issue. The following non-metric items were bolded: **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, **BERT**, **Redis**, **DynamoDB**, **GPT-4**, **Claude**, **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, **Tableau**, **PostgreSQL**. This clutters the resume and hurts scannability.\n\n**7. Historical Accuracy: 10/10**\n   - **Violations:** None. The technology stack listed for the pre-2023 role (ValueLabs) is historically accurate (Python, XGBoost, Scikit-learn). Modern LLM technologies are correctly placed in recent roles and projects.\n\n**8. Completeness: 3/5**\n   - **Missing:** The summary does not explicitly state \"**4+ years of experience**,\" which is a direct requirement from the job description.\n\n---\n### VERDICT:\nThis is a championship-level resume with outstanding content, perfect ATS alignment, and exceptionally well-crafted impact bullets. It will easily pass all automated and human screens. However, two minor but critical presentation errors are holding it back from being flawless. Fixing these will elevate it from a top 1% resume to a truly undeniable one.\n\n---\n### CRITICAL ISSUES (To reach 100/100):\nWhile the resume scores high enough for submission, the following fixes are non-negotiable for achieving perfection and will take less than 5 minutes.\n\n1.  **Fix Bolding Errors:** This is the most significant issue. **Only numbers and percentages should be bold.** Remove bolding from all technology names (e.g., **XGBoost**, **BERT**, **Python**). This will dramatically improve visual clarity and professional polish.\n2.  **Add Years of Experience to Summary:** The job description explicitly asks for \"4+ years of experience.\" The first sentence of the summary should be updated to reflect this directly. Change \"Machine Learning Engineer with extensive experience...\" to \"**Machine Learning Engineer with 4+ years of experience...**\"\n\n---\n### PRIORITIZED FIXES:\nThese fixes are high-impact and extremely low-effort.\n\n**HIGH PRIORITY (Will gain 12 points):**\n1.  **Correct Bolding (Gains 10 pts):** Go through every bullet point and un-bold all tool and technology names. This is purely a formatting change.\n2.  **Update Summary (Gains 2 pts):** Add the phrase \"**4+ years of experience**\" to the first sentence of your summary to match the job description's requirement perfectly.\n\n**MEDIUM PRIORITY:** None.\n\n**LOW PRIORITY:** None.\n\n---\n### ESTIMATED SCORE AFTER FIXES: 100/100",
