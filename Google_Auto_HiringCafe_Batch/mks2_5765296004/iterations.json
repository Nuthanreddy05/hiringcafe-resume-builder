ATS Keyword Match: 30/30**\n- **Found (15/15):**\n  - Microsoft Copilot (Summary, Experience, Projects, Skills)\n  - Dynamics 365 APIs (Experience, Projects, Skills)\n  - Microsoft Azure AI services (Summary, Experience, Projects, Skills)\n  - Power Platform (Experience, Projects, Skills)\n  - Python (Summary, Experience, Projects, Skills)\n  - C# (Experience, Projects, Skills)\n  - NLP (Summary, Experience, Projects, Skills)\n  - ML model deployment (Experience, Projects, Skills)\n  - Data engineering (Experience, Projects, Skills)\n  - Dataverse (Experience, Projects, Skills)\n  - Agile Scrum (Skills)\n  - custom plugins/extensions (Projects)\n  - Power BI (Experience, Skills)\n  - AI/ML engineering (Titles, Skills)\n  - Security/Compliance (Projects)\n- **Missing (0/15):** None. Perfect keyword alignment.\n\n**2. Toddler Summary: 20/20**\n- **Role 1 (Albertsons):** PASS - \"Built AI systems that helped the grocery company automate business processes and provide intelligent assistance to employees through conversational interfaces\"\n- **Role 2 (ValueLabs):** PASS - \"Supported enterprise clients by building AI-powered systems that automated business workflows and improved operational efficiency across multiple industries\"\n\n**3. Authenticity Tone: 15/15**\n- **Issues:** None. The resume exclusively uses strong, active \"worker\" verbs like 'Built', 'Designed', 'Developed', and 'Implemented'. Zero fluff verbs or passive voice detected.\n\n**4. XYZ Formula: 20/20**\n- **Strong Bullets: 6/6 sampled.** Every bullet effectively combines a quantified result (X), a specific action (Y), and the tools/context (Z).\n- **Weak Bullets:** None found. The structure is consistently impactful and clear.\n\n**5. Metric Realism: 10/10**\n- **Suspicious:** None. All metrics (e.g., \"25% efficiency,\" \"40% reduction in manual entry,\" \"5TB of data\") are specific, credible, and appropriate for the candidate's experience level and the scale of the employers.\n\n**6. Percentage Pop: 0/10**\n- **Incorrect Bolding:** The resume incorrectly bolds technologies and concepts instead of just the metrics. This is a major visual distraction.\n  - Examples: `\\textbf{Azure AI services}`, `\\textbf{Power Platform}`, `\\textbf{NLP solutions}`, `\\textbf{Python}`, `\\textbf{Dynamics 365 APIs}`, etc. (15+ instances)\n\n**7. Historical Accuracy: 10/10**\n- **Violations:** None. The pre-2023 role (ValueLabs) correctly lists technologies that were industry-standard for that period (Scikit-learn, Flask, Python) with no anachronistic mentions of modern GenAI tools.\n\n**8. Completeness: 5/5**\n- **Missing:** None. The resume correctly states \"3+ years of experience\" (matching the JD), includes two detailed projects, and has a well-organized, categorized skills section.\n\n---\n### VERDICT:\nThis is a championship-tier resume with near-perfect content, keyword optimization, and structure. It will sail through any ATS and immediately impress a human reviewer with its clarity and impact. However, a single, significant visual formatting error\u2014incorrect bolding\u2014prevents it from being flawless and slightly hinders its scannability.\n\n---\n### PRIORITIZED FIXES:\n\n**HIGH PRIORITY (Will gain 10+ points & perfect the 3-second scan):**\n\n1.  **Correct Bolding Immediately.** This is the *only* issue holding the resume back. The rule is simple: **only bold the numbers and metrics**. Remove bolding from all technologies, tools, and concepts.\n    -   **BEFORE:** \"Developed \\textbf{NLP solutions} using \\textbf{Python} ... reducing manual data entry by \\textbf{40\\%}\"\n    -   **AFTER:** \"Developed NLP solutions using Python ... reducing manual data entry by **40%**\"\n\n**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**\n- None.\n\n**LOW PRIORITY:**\n- None.\n\n---\n### ESTIMATED SCORE AFTER FIXES: **100/100**",
