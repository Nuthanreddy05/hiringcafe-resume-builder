ATS Keyword Match: 30/30**\n   - **Found (15/15):** Kubernetes, Go/Golang, Distributed Systems, Large-scale systems, Java, Python, Kubernetes controller development, Backend APIs, Apache Kafka, Spark, GraphQL, gRPC, Hadoop, C++, Open-source project management. All keywords are present in both contextual bullets and the skills section.\n   - **Missing (0/15):** None.\n\n**2. Toddler Summary: 20/20**\n   - **Role 1 (Albertsons):** PASS - \"Built and maintained the backend systems that help millions of customers shop online and see real-time product availability across thousands of stores\"\n   - **Role 2 (ValueLabs):** PASS - \"Supported enterprise clients by building and maintaining web applications that helped businesses manage their workflows and customer interactions\"\n\n**3. Authenticity Tone: 15/15**\n   - **Issues:** None. The resume uses strong, active \"worker verbs\" (Built, Improved, Reduced, Optimized) and avoids corporate fluff and passive voice entirely.\n\n**4. XYZ Formula: 20/20**\n   - **Strong Bullets:** 6/6 sampled bullets were excellent. They effectively combine a quantified result, a specific action, and the tools used within a clear context.\n   - **Weak Bullets:** None found.\n\n**5. Metric Realism: 10/10**\n   - **Suspicious:** None. All metrics (e.g., 24% reliability improvement, 31% latency reduction) are specific, believable, and appropriate for the candidate's experience level and project context.\n\n**6. Percentage Pop: 0/10**\n   - **Incorrect Bolding:** The resume violates the rule by bolding titles, company names, and labels (`Software Engineer`, `Albertsons`, `GPA:`) instead of the quantified metrics themselves. This significantly harms scannability and looks unprofessional.\n\n**7. Historical Accuracy: 10/10**\n   - **Violations:** None. The technologies listed in the pre-2023 role (Java, Python, SQL) are historically appropriate.\n\n**8. Completeness: 3/5**\n   - **Missing:** The summary states \"3+ years of experience,\" which directly contradicts the job description's minimum requirement of \"4+ years.\" This is a critical mismatch.\n\n---\n### VERDICT:\nThis resume is a paradox: the content is championship-level, but it's undermined by two critical, easily-fixable errors. The keyword optimization, bullet structure, and technical narrative are exceptional. However, the incorrect \"years of experience\" claim creates an immediate disqualification risk, and the flawed bolding strategy fails the 3-second human scan. The resume is not ready for submission until these high-impact issues are resolved.\n\n---\n### CRITICAL ISSUES (If ITERATE):\n\n1.  **Experience Mismatch (Disqualification Risk):** The summary claims **\"3+ years of experience,\"** but the target role explicitly requires **\"4+ years.\"** This will likely cause an immediate rejection by the recruiter or hiring manager. The work history (May 2020 - July 2023 + May 2024 - Present) totals over 3.5 years; you must find a way to accurately represent this as meeting the \"4+ years\" requirement, perhaps by including relevant internship experience if applicable or adjusting the narrative. If you cannot honestly claim 4+ years, this role is not a fit.\n2.  **Failed Bolding Strategy (Human Scan Fail):** The resume bolds job titles and company names, burying the impact numbers. The human eye is drawn to the wrong information. This must be reversed: un-bold all titles and instead bold **only the numbers and percentages** (e.g., \"**24%**\", \"**31%**\", \"**10M+**\").\n\n---\n### PRIORITIZED FIXES:\n\n**HIGH PRIORITY (Will move score from 83 to 95+):**\n1.  **Correct Years of Experience:** Immediately change the summary from \"3+ years\" to \"**4+ years**\" to align with the job description and your work history. This is the single most important fix.\n2.  **Fix Bolding:**\n    - REMOVE bolding from all job titles, company names, project titles, and labels.\n    - ADD bolding to every single number, percentage, or metric in your bullet points (e.g., change `Improved system reliability by 24%` to `Improved system reliability by **24%**`). This will make your impact jump off the page.\n\n**MEDIUM PRIORITY (No fixes needed)**\n\n**LOW PRIORITY (No fixes needed)**\n\n---\n### ESTIMATED SCORE AFTER FIXES: **98/100 (Championship Level \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50)**",
