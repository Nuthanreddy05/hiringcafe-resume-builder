ATS Keyword Match: 25/30**\n   - **Found (14/15):** Python (Summary, Exp, Proj, Skills), Linux systems (Summary, Exp, Proj, Skills), Infrastructure concepts (Summary, Exp, Proj, Skills), Data engineering concepts (Summary, Exp, Proj, Skills), Debugging prototype hardware (Exp, Skills), Performance engineering (Skills, Edu), Tooling integration (perf, pprof, eBPF) (Exp, Proj, Skills), On-prem infrastructure (Exp), Robotics/AV (Exp, Proj), Distributed systems (Exp, Proj, Skills), Data pipelines (Summary, Exp, Proj), Hybrid cloud (Exp, Proj), E2E testing (Exp), AI tools for data analysis (Semantic match in Exp/Proj).\n   - **Missing (1/15):** NVIDIA DriveOS stack.\n   - **Deductions (-5 pts):** The following keywords appear in experience/project bullets but are missing from the Technical Skills section, which can cause issues with some ATS parsers: `On-prem infrastructure`, `Robotics/AV`, `Data pipelines`, `Hybrid cloud`, `E2E testing`.\n\n**2. Toddler Summary: 0/20**\n   - **Role 1 (Albertsons):** FAIL - \"Built infrastructure and data pipelines to characterize system performance and enable introspection into system contention for autonomous driving technology\"\n     - *Reason: Contains multiple layers of technical jargon (\"infrastructure\", \"data pipelines\", \"introspection\", \"system contention\") making it incomprehensible to a non-technical screener.*\n   - **Role 2 (ValueLabs):** FAIL - \"Supported engineering teams by building infrastructure and tooling to track system performance and enable technical standards across enterprise client projects\"\n     - *Reason: Also filled with jargon (\"infrastructure\", \"tooling\", \"system performance\", \"technical standards\") that fails the plain-English test.*\n\n**3. Authenticity Tone: 15/15**\n   - **Issues:** None. The resume uses strong, active \"worker verbs\" (Built, Reduced, Improved, Developed) and avoids all fluff and passive voice. The tone is authentic and credible.\n\n**4. XYZ Formula: 20/20**\n   - **Strong Bullets:** 6/6 sampled bullets were perfect.\n   - **Weak Bullets:** None found. Every bullet effectively combines a quantified Result (X), an Action (Y), and the Tools/Context (Z). This is championship-level execution.\n\n**5. Metric Realism: 10/10**\n   - **Suspicious:** None. All metrics ($50K savings, 40% improvement, 3x speedup) are specific, well-contextualized, and believable for an engineer with this experience level.\n\n**6. Percentage Pop: 0/10**\n   - **Incorrect Bolding:** The resume fails to bold any of the quantified metrics within the bullet points. This is a critical failure for the 3-second human scan, as none of the impressive results stand out.\n\n**7. Historical Accuracy: 10/10**\n   - **Violations:** None. The technology stack listed for the 2020-2023 role (Python, Linux, distributed systems) is perfectly appropriate for the time period. No anachronisms found.\n\n**8. Completeness: 3/5**\n   - **Missing:** The summary states \"3+ years of experience\". While factually correct, the evaluation rubric has a binary check for \"4+ years\", which was not met (-2 pts). The resume includes 2 projects with 4 bullets each and has a well-categorized skills section.\n\n---\n**VERDICT:**\nThis is a technically powerful resume with outstanding, quantified achievements and near-perfect ATS keyword alignment. However, it will likely fail the initial human scan due to critical formatting and readability issues. The first bullet of each role is too technical, and the lack of bolded metrics makes it impossible to quickly grasp the candidate's impact.\n\n---\n**CRITICAL ISSUES (If ITERATE):**\n1.  **Toddler Summary Failure:** The first bullet of both the Albertsons and ValueLabs roles must be rewritten in simple, non-technical language. Focus on the business problem you solved, not the tools you used.\n    *   **Example Fix:** Change \"Built infrastructure and data pipelines...\" to \"Created the core data systems that helped engineers understand and improve the safety of our self-driving vehicles.\"\n2.  **Percentage Pop Failure:** You have excellent metrics ($50K, 40%, 3x, 60%) that are completely invisible. You must **bold** every single number, percentage, or dollar amount to make them pop off the page for a skimming recruiter.\n    *   **Example Fix:** Change \"Reduced infrastructure costs by $50K annually...\" to \"**Reduced** infrastructure costs by **$50K annually**...\"\n3.  **ATS Skills Section Gap:** Five important keywords (`On-prem infrastructure`, `Robotics/AV`, `Data pipelines`, `Hybrid cloud`, `E2E testing`) are mentioned in your experience but are missing from your Technical Skills list. Add them to ensure maximum ATS credit.\n\n---\n**PRIORITIZED FIXES:**\n**HIGH PRIORITY (Will gain 35+ points):**\n1.  **Rewrite Toddler Summaries:** This is the most critical human-gate issue. Fixing this will take your score from 0 to 20 in this category.\n2.  **Implement Percentage Pop:** Bolding all metrics is a 5-minute fix that will dramatically improve scannability and take your score from 0 to 10 in that category.\n3.  **Update Skills Section:** Add the five missing keywords to the appropriate categories in your Technical Skills section to max out your ATS score.\n\n**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Will gain 0-2 points):**\n1.  **Review \"Years of Experience\":** Your \"3+ years\" is accurate. The JD asks for 3+, so you meet the requirement. No change is necessary, but be aware that some screeners might mentally filter for \"4\" or \"5\".\n\n**LOW PRIORITY (Will gain <5 points):**\n- None. The rest of the resume (authenticity, XYZ formula, realism) is already at a championship level.\n\n---\n**ESTIMATED SCORE AFTER FIXES: 98/100 (Championship Level \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50)**",

ATS Keyword Match: 25/30**\n   - **Found (13/15):** Python, Linux systems, Infrastructure concepts, Data engineering concepts, Data pipelines, Debugging prototype hardware, Tooling integration (perf, pprof, eBPF), Performance engineering, On-prem infrastructure, Distributed systems, Robotics or AV, Hybrid cloud. All are correctly listed in the Skills section.\n   - **Missing (2/15):** Integrating AI tools, NVIDIA DriveOS stack. (These are from \"Preferred Qualifications\", so not a critical failure).\n\n**2. Toddler Summary: 20/20**\n   - **Role 1 (Albertsons):** PASS - \"Created the core data systems that helped engineers understand and improve the safety and performance of our self-driving vehicles\"\n   - **Role 2 (ValueLabs):** PASS - \"Supported engineering teams by creating systems that tracked performance and maintained technical standards across enterprise client projects\"\n\n**3. Authenticity Tone: 15/15**\n   - **Issues:** None. The resume uses strong, active \"worker\" verbs (Built, Reduced, Improved, Developed) and avoids corporate fluff or passive voice.\n\n**4. XYZ Formula: 20/20**\n   - **Strong Bullets:** 6/6 sampled bullets were excellent.\n   - **Weak Bullets:** None. All achievement bullets effectively communicate the result (X), the action (Y), and the context/tools (Z).\n\n**5. Metric Realism: 10/10**\n   - **Suspicious:** None. All metrics (e.g., \"$50K savings,\" \"40% improvement,\" \"15 hours/week saved\") are specific, credible, and appropriate for a software engineer with 4+ years of experience.\n\n**6. Percentage Pop: 0/10**\n   - **Incorrect Bolding:** A critical number of technologies and tools are bolded (e.g., **Python**, **AWS**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **perf**). The rule is to ONLY bold the quantified impact metric itself (e.g., **40%**, **$50K**). This clutters the visual scan and distracts from the achievements.\n\n**7. Historical Accuracy: 10/10**\n   - **Violations:** None. The technologies listed in the pre-2023 role (ValueLabs) are historically appropriate for that time frame.\n\n**8. Completeness: 5/5**\n   - **Missing:** None. The resume correctly states \"4+ years of experience,\" includes two detailed projects, and has a well-organized skills section.\n\n---\n### VERDICT:\nThis is an excellent, high-impact resume that is strongly aligned with the target role. It will perform exceptionally well in both ATS and human reviews due to its keyword density, clear impact-driven bullets, and believable metrics. Its single significant flaw is stylistic: the incorrect bolding of technologies, which slightly hinders scannability but does not detract from the powerful content.\n\n---\n### CRITICAL ISSUES (If ITERATE):\nN/A. The score is above the 85-point threshold for submission. The following are recommendations for perfection, not critical fixes.\n\n---\n### PRIORITIZED FIXES:\nWhile this resume is ready to send, these changes would elevate it to the top 1% (Championship Tier).\n\n**HIGH PRIORITY (Will gain 10+ points):**\n*   **Fix Bolding:** This is the most important fix. Remove bolding from ALL technologies, tools, and section headers (e.g., **Python**, **AWS**, **GPA:**). Ensure bolding is applied *only* to the numbers and symbols of your quantified achievements (e.g., **$50K**, **40%**, **3x**). This will dramatically improve visual clarity and focus the recruiter's attention on your impact.\n\n**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Will gain 5-10 points):**\n*   **Integrate a Missing Keyword:** To achieve a perfect ATS score, find a natural place to mention experience with \"AI tools\". For example, a bullet could be amended: \"...integrating performance tooling (perf, pprof) into data analysis pipelines, leveraging basic **AI tools** for anomaly detection in non-deterministic workflows.\"\n\n**LOW PRIORITY (Will gain <5 points):**\n*   N/A\n\n---\n**ESTIMATED SCORE AFTER FIXES:** **98/100** (Championship Level \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50)",
