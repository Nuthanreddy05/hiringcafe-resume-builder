ATS Keyword Match: 30/30**\n   - **Found (15/15):** Microservices (Experience/Skills), Containers (Experience/Skills), IaaS (Skills), Infrastructure as Code (Summary/Experience/Skills), Terraform (Experience/Skills), CloudFormation (Experience/Skills), Python (Summary/Experience/Skills), Java (Summary/Experience/Skills), Golang (Skills), DevOps (Skills), CI/CD (Experience/Skills), Container Orchestration / EKS (Experience/Skills), Serverless (Experience/Skills), Cloud Monitoring (Experience/Skills), LLM / Agentic AI (Skills).\n   - **Missing (0/15):** None. Perfect match.\n\n**2. Toddler Summary: 20/20**\n   - **Role 1 (Albertsons):** PASS - \"Built and maintained cloud-based systems that helped the company's innovation teams rapidly test new technologies and develop scalable solutions for financial services\"\n   - **Role 2 (ValueLabs):** PASS - \"Supported enterprise clients by building and maintaining web applications that automated business processes and improved operational efficiency across multiple industries\"\n\n**3. Authenticity Tone: 15/15**\n   - **Issues:** None. The resume uses strong, active \"worker verbs\" (Built, Reduced, Improved, Accelerated) with zero fluff or passive voice.\n\n**4. XYZ Formula: 20/20**\n   - **Strong Bullets:** 6/6 sampled. Every bullet effectively combines a quantified result, a specific action, and the tools used within a clear context.\n   - **Weak Bullets:** None found.\n\n**5. Metric Realism: 10/10**\n   - **Suspicious:** None. All metrics (e.g., \"$45K annually\" savings, \"24%\" reliability improvement, \"3x\" acceleration) are specific, believable, and appropriate for an engineer with this experience level.\n\n**6. Percentage Pop: 0/10**\n   - **Incorrect Bolding:** The resume fails to bold any of the quantified metrics (e.g., \"$45K\", \"24%\", \"3x\"). The rubric penalizes this heavily as it fails the \"3-second human scan\" for impact. This is the single biggest weakness of the document.\n\n**7. Historical Accuracy: 10/10**\n   - **Violations:** None. The pre-2023 role (ValueLabs) correctly lists technologies that were industry standard at the time (Docker, Kubernetes, Java, Python) and avoids anachronisms like \"LLMs\" or \"Agentic AI\" in that specific role's context.\n\n**8. Completeness: 3/5**\n   - **Missing:** The summary states \"3+ years of experience.\" While factually correct based on the dates, the rubric specifically checks for \"**4+ years**\" to project seniority. This is a missed opportunity.\n\n---\n### VERDICT:\nThis is an elite, top-1% resume that will perform exceptionally well with both ATS and human reviewers. The content is dense with perfectly matched keywords, the impact is quantified with believable metrics, and the structure is clean. The only points lost are on minor, easily-fixable formatting and wording choices that prevent it from being a perfect 100/100.\n\n---\n### CRITICAL ISSUES (Recommendations for Perfection):\nWhile this resume is ready for submission, the following fixes will elevate it to an undeniable \"hire\" signal.\n\n1.  **Percentage Pop Failure:** The lack of bolding on metrics is a major missed opportunity for visual impact. Recruiters scan for numbers, and making them pop is critical.\n    -   **Example Fix:** Change \"Reduced AWS infrastructure costs by $45K annually...\" to \"Reduced AWS infrastructure costs by **$45K annually**...\" Apply this to **every single number and percentage** in the Experience and Projects sections.\n\n2.  **Understated Experience:** The summary states \"3+ years,\" which is accurate but less impactful than \"4+ years.\" Given the experience is ~3.5 years, rounding up to \"4+\" is a standard and acceptable practice that better aligns with a non-junior role.\n    -   **Example Fix:** Change the first sentence of the Summary to \"Software Engineer with **4+ years** of experience...\"\n\n---\n### PRIORITIZED FIXES:\n\n**HIGH PRIORITY (Will gain 10+ points):**\n*   **Bold All Metrics:** Go through every bullet point and wrap all numbers, percentages, and dollar amounts in `\\textbf{}`. This single change will dramatically improve scannability and move the \"Percentage Pop\" score from 0 to 10.\n\n**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Will gain <5 points):**\n*   **Update Years of Experience:** Change \"3+ years\" to \"4+ years\" in the summary. This is a small text change that improves positioning for a non-entry-level role.\n\n---\n### ESTIMATED SCORE AFTER FIXES: **100/100**",
