Scores have been normalized to 100.*\n\n**1. ATS Keyword Match: 28/30**\n   - **Found (14/15):** GCP, AWS, CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Terraform, Automation workflows, Monitoring tools, Logging tools, Observability tools, Blockchain, Smart contracts, Security controls, Compliance processes, Scaling infrastructure.\n   - **Missing (1/15):** Fintech (explicitly).\n   - **Notes:** Strong keyword alignment. Score was reduced by 2 points because \"Blockchain\" and \"Smart contracts\" appear in experience bullets but are missing from the Technical Skills section.\n\n**2. Toddler Summary: 20/20**\n   - **Role 1 (Albertsons):** PASS - \"Managed cloud infrastructure and automation systems to support the company's rapidly evolving product, helping millions of users access services reliably across global markets\"\n   - **Role 2 (ValueLabs):** PASS - \"Supported enterprise clients by building and maintaining reliable infrastructure systems that processed customer data securely across multiple cloud environments\"\n   - **Notes:** Excellent. Both bullets are clear, business-focused, and free of jargon and metrics.\n\n**3. Authenticity Tone: 15/15**\n   - **Issues:** None. The resume uses strong, active \"worker verbs\" (Managed, Reduced, Implemented, Built) and avoids corporate fluff and passive voice.\n\n**4. XYZ Formula: 20/20**\n   - **Strong Bullets:** 6/6 sampled bullets were excellent.\n   - **Weak Bullets:** None found. All bullets effectively combine a quantified result, a specific action, the tools used, and the business context.\n\n**5. Metric Realism: 10/10**\n   - **Suspicious:** None. All metrics (e.g., 28% reduction, $45K annual savings, 99.9% uptime) are specific, believable, and appropriate for the candidate's experience level.\n\n**6. Percentage Pop: 0/10**\n   - **Incorrect Bolding:** The resume fails to bold any of the quantified metrics within the bullet points. This is a major missed opportunity for visual scannability.\n\n**7. Historical Accuracy: 10/10**\n   - **Violations:** None. All technologies mentioned in the pre-2023 role (Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, etc.) are historically appropriate for that time period.\n\n**8. Completeness: 3/5**\n   - **Missing:**\n     - The summary states \"3+ years of experience.\" While technically accurate, the timeline (starting May 2020) supports a stronger claim of \"4+ years,\" which is more impactful. (-2 pts)\n\n---\n### VERDICT:\nThis is a very strong resume that will perform well with both ATS and human reviewers. The content is specific, the metrics are believable, and the structure is clean. It passes the critical \"Toddler Test\" with flying colors, ensuring a recruiter immediately understands the business impact. The only significant weaknesses are visual (lack of metric bolding) and a minor underselling of total experience in the summary.\n\n---\n### CRITICAL ISSUES (Recommendations for a 95+ Score):\nWhile this resume is ready for submission, the following fixes are highly recommended to elevate it to the top 1% of applications.\n\n1.  **Visual Scan Failure:** The most impactful metrics (28%, $45K, 60%) are not bolded. A recruiter's eye will not be drawn to your key achievements during a 3-second scan. This is the single biggest opportunity for improvement.\n2.  **Understated Experience:** The summary claims \"3+ years\" of experience. Since your first relevant role started in May 2020, you can confidently claim \"**4+ years**\" of experience, which is a stronger signal to recruiters.\n3.  **Incomplete Skills Section:** The keywords \"Blockchain\" and \"Smart contracts\" are mentioned in your experience but are missing from your Technical Skills section. This is an ATS risk and a minor inconsistency.\n\n---\n### PRIORITIZED FIXES:\n*Implementing these changes should take less than 15 minutes and will significantly boost the resume's impact.*\n\n**HIGH PRIORITY (Will gain 10+ points):**\n-   **Fix Percentage Pop:** Go through every bullet point and bold all numbers, percentages, and dollar amounts (e.g., \"**28%**\", \"**$45K**\", \"**50+** microservices\").\n-   **Fix Year Check:** Change \"3+ years\" in the summary to \"**4+ years**\".\n\n**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Will gain <5 points):**\n-   **Fix ATS Keywords:** Add \"Blockchain\" and \"Smart Contracts\" to your Technical Skills section, perhaps under a new \"Web3 & Distributed Systems\" category or alongside \"Programming & Scripting\".\n\n---\n### ESTIMATED SCORE AFTER FIXES: 100/100 (Championship Level \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50)",
