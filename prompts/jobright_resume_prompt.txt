## THE TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK - CRITICAL LOGIC

**Step One - Identify Type:** Is this requirement a TECHNICAL SKILL or DOMAIN WORK? Technical skills are programming languages, frameworks, cloud platforms. Domain work refers to business-specific terminology.

**Step Two - Handle Technical Skills:** If it is a technical skill, KEEP IT EXACTLY AS WRITTEN. Do not translate or modify Python, AWS, machine learning, Docker, SQL, or any technical framework.

**Step Three - Handle Domain Work:** If it is domain work, translate to Albertsons equivalent. "Insurance claims processing" becomes "prescription insurance coordination". "Video streaming platform" becomes "AI-powered video content generation".

**Step Four - Validation Check:** Could I walk into Albertsons headquarters and find a real department doing this work? If YES, use the translated version. If NO, skip that requirement.

**Step Five - Skip Impossible Work:** Clinical drug trials, gene sequencing, satellite navigation systems, social media platform as external product - these have no Albertsons equivalent. Skip them entirely.

## CRITICAL: CLOUD PLATFORM MATCHING REQUIREMENT

**Before writing any bullets, check the job description for cloud platform requirements:**

**IF JD EXPLICITLY REQUIRES Azure:**
- Use Azure services in bullets: Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Cache for Redis, Azure Functions
- Do NOT use AWS services when Azure is required
- Do NOT list Azure in skills if you won't use it in bullets

**IF JD EXPLICITLY REQUIRES GCP:**
- Use GCP services in bullets: BigQuery, Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage, Dataproc, Cloud Run
- Do NOT use AWS services when GCP is required
- Do NOT list GCP in skills if you won't use it in bullets

**IF JD SAYS "AWS OR Azure OR GCP" (any acceptable):**
- Choose one platform and use it consistently
- AWS is most common - use: Lambda, S3, EMR, Glue, EKS, ElastiCache

**IF JD REQUIRES SPECIFIC TOOLS (Maven, Hibernate, Jenkins, BigQuery, Grafana, Splunk):**
- Mention these tools in at least 1-2 bullets
- Example: "using Spring Boot and Maven" or "monitoring with Grafana"

**VALIDATION:** If JD requires a specific cloud/tool, did I use it in bullets? If no, either add it OR remove from skills section.

## INTERNAL VS EXTERNAL SOFTWARE - CRITICAL DISTINCTION

Albertsons builds software to SUPPORT their grocery retail business (internal systems). Albertsons does NOT sell software as products to other companies (external products).

**Examples You CAN Claim:** Built e-commerce platform for Albertsons customers. Developed inventory management system for 2,300 Albertsons stores. Created pharmacy prescription tracking system. Built fraud detection for Albertsons payment transactions.

**Examples You CANNOT Claim:** Built SaaS platform sold to 500 enterprise clients. Developed video streaming service with 10 million subscribers. Created social media platform. Built API marketplace where external developers purchase access.

---

## RESUME STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

### SUMMARY SECTION - EXACTLY FOUR TO SIX LINES

**Line One:** State the role title with 4 years of experience in the relevant domain from the JD.

**Line Two:** List specialization in the top 3 to 4 JD technical skills.

**Line Three:** Include one proven quantified achievement using an IRREGULAR number (23%, 27%, 34%, 18%, 41%, 47%, 58%, 67%, 73%). NEVER use round numbers (20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%).

**CRITICAL RULE - METRIC UNIQUENESS:** After generating your entire resume, search for every percentage and dollar amount. If the SAME number appears in summary AND any bullet, change the summary to use a different irregular number. Example: If Bullet 2 uses "27%", summary must use "29%" or "26%", never "27%".

**Line Four:** Describe what you are currently doing at Albertsons.

**Line Five (optional):** Add additional relevant context if needed.

---

### JOB TITLES - NO SENIORITY MODIFIERS

Extract the core role from the job description. "Senior Data Scientist II" becomes "Data Scientist". "Lead Software Engineer" becomes "Software Engineer".

**Critical Requirement:** Both Albertsons role and ValueLabs role must use the EXACT SAME title.

---

### ALBERTSONS EXPERIENCE - EXACTLY SEVEN BULLETS

#### BULLET ONE - THE TODDLER SUMMARY - ZERO JARGON RULE

**Absolutely Forbidden:** API, microservice, pipeline, architecture, backend, frontend, infrastructure, ETL, database, framework, algorithm, Python, Java, SQL, AWS, Azure, Docker, React, ANY tool name, ANY percentage, ANY dollar amount, ANY numbers.

**What IS Allowed:** company, business, customers, shoppers, platform, system, stores, built, created, helped, enabled, improved (without numbers), accuracy, efficiency, errors, speed, quality.

**Template:** Built [business system] that helped [end users] [solve business problem] for [scale with NO numbers].

**Example:** "Built data systems that helped the company understand customer shopping patterns across online and in-store purchases, enabling personalized product recommendations for millions of weekly shoppers."

---

#### BULLETS TWO THROUGH SEVEN - TECHNICAL EXECUTION

**Length:** 1.5 to 2 lines when rendered (140 to 250 characters).

**Pattern A - System Outcome (40% of bullets):** [System name] achieved [result] through [implementation] using [exact tools], [context].

**Pattern B - Collaborative Contribution (35% of bullets):** Contributed to [team/initiative] by [technical work] using [exact tools], [quantified result].

**Pattern C - Problem Solution Result (25% of bullets):** Faced with [business problem], [implemented solution] using [exact tools], [achieving result].

**Tool Specificity:** Always name the EXACT tool. Write "Redis" not "caching solution". Write "AWS Lambda, S3, Glue" not "AWS services".

**Metric Variance:** Use IRREGULAR numbers (23%, 27%, 34%, 18%, 41%, 47%, 58%, 67%, 73%). NEVER repeat the same percentage twice in the entire resume.

**Collaboration Language:** Write "Platform achieved..." or "Contributed to...", NOT "Single-handedly architected".

---

### VALUELABS EXPERIENCE - EXACTLY SIX BULLETS

#### BULLET ONE - CONSULTANT FRAMING

**Template:** Supported [industry type] clients by building [solution type] that [business outcome] across [engagement scope].

**Example:** "Supported enterprise clients across retail, finance, and healthcare industries by building data analytics platforms that processed business information and enabled data-driven decision-making for diverse operational needs."

---

#### BULLETS TWO THROUGH SIX - LOWER SCOPE THAN ALBERTSONS

**Scope Reduction:** ValueLabs should show LESS scope than Albertsons. Data volume: 50GB-1TB daily (vs 1TB-10TB at Albertsons). Users: 10K-500K (vs 1M-10M). Cost savings: $10K-$50K (vs $40K-$100K).

**Technology Era Constraints - ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL:**

**FORBIDDEN at ValueLabs (2020-2023):** GPT-3.5, GPT-4, ChatGPT, Claude, LangChain, LlamaIndex, RAG, vector databases (Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate), prompt engineering, AI Agents, Agentic AI.

---

### PROJECTS SECTION - EXACTLY TWO PROJECTS

**Timeline Rules:** Project 1: Aug 2023 - Dec 2023. Project 2: Jan 2024 - **Apr 2024** (NOT May 2024 - this creates overlap with Albertsons start date).

**Project Selection:** Project 1 should match top 3-5 JD requirements. Project 2 should show complementary skills.

**Bullet Structure:**
- Bullet One: Design/architecture phase
- Bullet Two: Implementation with specific tools
- Bullet Three: Results with metrics
- Optional Bullet Four: Deployment/additional detail

**Academic Context:** Use "simulated data", "academic dataset", "validation testing", "load testing scenario", "proof-of-concept", "graduate research project".

---

### SKILLS SECTION - EDUCATION-BASED SKILLS ARE VALID

**Critical Understanding:** Skills can come from THREE legitimate sources:
1. Professional experience (appears in bullets)
2. Academic coursework (learned in MS/undergrad programs)
3. Self-study / certifications

**What TO Include:**
- Skills you learned in formal education (Java from CS courses, R from statistics, Git from software engineering)
- Skills from past work not used in current role (Docker learned but not in production yet)
- Alternative frameworks in same domain (PyTorch if you use TensorFlow professionally)
- Infrastructure skills assumed but not mentioned (Git, CI/CD, Bash)

**What IS Keyword Stuffing:**
- Skills completely irrelevant to your field (Photoshop for data scientist, Salesforce for software engineer)
- Technologies you have zero exposure to (Blockchain if never studied, Mandarin if don't speak)
- Tools added purely for keyword matching with no learning path

**Validation Question:** Can you explain WHERE you learned this skill? (Education, past job, self-study) If YES → Include it. If NO → Delete it.

**Structure:** Organize into 4-6 categories. Each category: 5-8 items maximum. Top 12-15 keywords from JD must be present.

**Forbidden:** NO soft skills (Leadership, Communication, Teamwork, Problem Solving).

---

## LATEX FORMATTING RULES

**BOLD ONLY METRICS:** `\textbf{34\%}`, `\textbf{\$47K}`, `\textbf{2TB}`, `\textbf{8M}`

**NEVER BOLD:** Technology names, tools, frameworks, action verbs, ANY text that is not a number.

**Special Characters:** `\%` for percent, `\$` for dollar, `\&` for ampersand.

---

## PRE-GENERATION VALIDATION CHECKLIST

**Validation One:** Translated all domain terms to Albertsons context?

**Validation Two:** Kept 100% of technical skills exactly as-is from JD?

**Validation Three:** Every software system built FOR Albertsons, NOT SOLD BY Albertsons?

**Validation Four:** Can name the specific Albertsons department for each claimed work?

**Validation Five:** Bullet 1 of Albertsons and ValueLabs contains ZERO jargon, tools, metrics?

**Validation Six:** Using collaborative language, not solo hero claims?

**Validation Seven:** Avoided GPT-4, LangChain, RAG in ValueLabs 2020-2023?

**Validation Eight:** All percentages irregular and NO duplicates anywhere in resume?

**Validation Nine:** Projects dated Aug 2023-Dec 2023 and Jan 2024-Apr 2024 (NOT May 2024)?

**Validation Ten:** If JD requires specific cloud (Azure/GCP) or tools, did I use them in bullets?

**Validation Eleven - FINAL METRIC CHECK:** Search your completed resume for every percentage (%, dollar sign). Create a list. If ANY number appears twice, change one instance. This is mandatory.
