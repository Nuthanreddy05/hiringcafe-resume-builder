- **Current Role:** 20 months at Albertsons (May 2024 - Present, as of January 2026)
- **Previous Role:** 3 years 2 months at ValueLabs (May 2020 - July 2023)
- **Education:** MS Data Science, UT Arlington (Aug 2023 - May 2025, GPA 3.8)
- **Total Experience:** 4 years 8 months

**Critical Business Reality:** Albertsons is a Fortune 50 grocery retail corporation with 2,300+ stores, 1,800 pharmacies, and $70B revenue. They build INTERNAL software for grocery operations. They do NOT sell software products, run streaming services, operate social media platforms, or conduct clinical trials.

---

## EVALUATION FRAMEWORK - 10 CRITICAL DIMENSIONS

Each dimension is scored 0-10 points. Maximum total score is 100 points.

---

### **DIMENSION 1: DEPARTMENT CREDIBILITY (0-10 points)**

**What to Check:**
Does every claimed responsibility align with a real Albertsons department?

**Real Departments at Albertsons:**
1. **Pharmacy & Health:** Prescription management, HIPAA compliance, medication inventory, insurance coordination, refund processing
2. **E-Commerce & Digital:** Online grocery shopping, mobile apps, curbside pickup, delivery logistics
3. **Payments & Financial Ops:** POS transactions, fraud detection, dynamic pricing, financial reporting
4. **Supply Chain:** Warehouse management, fleet routing, inventory forecasting, demand planning
5. **Customer 360 Data:** Unified customer data, recommendation engines, behavior analytics, ML pipelines, BI
6. **IT Infrastructure:** Cloud platforms (AWS/Azure), microservices, CI/CD, DevOps, cybersecurity
7. **Marketing & Store Ops:** Digital campaigns, video content generation, store analytics, employee scheduling

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **10 points:** Every bullet clearly maps to a specific real department. Zero impossible claims.
- **7-9 points:** 1-2 minor stretches but generally believable department alignment.
- **4-6 points:** 3-4 questionable claims that don't clearly fit any department.
- **0-3 points:** Multiple impossible claims (e.g., clinical trials, satellite systems, social media platform).

**Auto-Fail Triggers (Automatic 0 points):**
- Claims Albertsons sells SaaS products to external companies
- Mentions clinical drug trials, gene sequencing, biotech research
- Describes building external software products with paying enterprise clients
- Claims building social media platform, video streaming service, or content platform as external product

---

### **DIMENSION 2: INTERNAL VS EXTERNAL SOFTWARE DISTINCTION (0-10 points)**

**What to Check:**
Is every software system described as INTERNAL (built for Albertsons' business) vs EXTERNAL (sold as product)?

**Red Flags to Catch:**
- "Multi-tenant SaaS platform serving 500 clients" (Albertsons doesn't sell SaaS)
- "API marketplace where developers purchase access" (not a developer platform company)
- "CRM product licensed to other retailers" (don't sell software to competitors)
- "Platform with 10M external subscribers" (internal systems serve employees/customers, not subscribers)

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **10 points:** Every system is clearly internal. All software supports grocery retail operations.
- **7-9 points:** 1 ambiguous claim but context suggests internal use.
- **4-6 points:** 2-3 descriptions that sound like external products.
- **0-3 points:** Multiple clear external product claims that Albertsons doesn't do.

---

### **DIMENSION 3: DOMAIN TRANSLATION ACCURACY (0-10 points)**

**What to Check:**
Were domain-specific terms from the JD properly translated to Albertsons equivalents?

**Good Translations:**
- "Insurance claims processing" → "Prescription insurance coordination" ✓
- "Patient diagnosis prediction" → "Medication demand forecasting" ✓
- "Video streaming platform" → "Marketing video content generation" ✓
- "Investment trading algorithms" → "Dynamic pricing optimization" ✓
- "Content recommendation engine" → "Product recommendation engine" ✓

**Bad Translations (Red Flags):**
- Using exact JD terms that don't apply: "clinical trials", "gene therapy", "satellite navigation"
- Claiming work Albertsons doesn't do: "social media moderation", "video game rendering"
- Generic vague translations: "business operations" instead of specific Albertsons context

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **10 points:** All domain terms perfectly translated to believable Albertsons work.
- **7-9 points:** 1-2 slightly generic translations but no impossible claims.
- **4-6 points:** 3-4 untranslated terms that don't fit grocery retail.
- **0-3 points:** Multiple direct copy-paste JD terms with no Albertsons context.

---

### **DIMENSION 4: TECHNICAL SKILLS PRESERVATION (0-10 points)**

**What to Check:**
Were technical skills kept EXACTLY as written in the JD without translation?

**Technical Skills (Must Keep Exact):**
- Programming languages: Python, Java, SQL, JavaScript, R, Scala, C++
- Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Django, React, Spring Boot, Flask
- Cloud platforms: AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes
- Tools: Git, Jenkins, Airflow, Kafka, Spark, Redis, PostgreSQL

**CRITICAL: CLOUD PLATFORM REQUIREMENT MATCHING**

**IF JD EXPLICITLY REQUIRES Azure or GCP:**
- Check if resume uses Azure/GCP in experience bullets (NOT just skills section)
- If JD requires "Azure" but ALL bullets use AWS → **Deduct 3 points (score max 7/10)**
- If Azure/GCP listed in skills but NEVER used in bullets → Treat as orphaned skill + cloud requirement mismatch

**IF JD REQUIRES SPECIFIC TOOLS (Maven, Hibernate, Jenkins, BigQuery, Grafana, Splunk):**
- Mention these tools in at least 1-2 bullets
- If listed in skills but never in bullets → Note as orphaned + weak technical match

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **10 points:** All technical skills from JD exact + cloud platform matches JD requirement if specified.
- **7-9 points:** 1-2 skills slightly paraphrased OR cloud mismatch (Azure required but AWS used).
- **4-6 points:** 3-4 technical skills translated OR major cloud mismatch + multiple missing required tools.
- **0-3 points:** Multiple technical skills altered, missing, or replaced with vague terms.

**Report Format for Cloud Platform Mismatch:**
```json
{
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "dimension": "technical_preservation",
  "location": "Cloud Platform Usage vs JD Requirement",
  "issue": "JD explicitly requires 'Azure or GCP' but resume demonstrates ONLY AWS experience. Azure/GCP listed in skills but NEVER used in any bullet.",
  "example": "JD: 'Strong experience with Azure or Google GCP' BUT all 7 cloud mentions use AWS: ElastiCache, EMR, Glue, EKS, EC2, S3, Lambda. Skills list Azure/GCP but these are orphaned.",
  "fix": "OPTION 1: Replace 2-3 AWS mentions with Azure equivalents: 'Azure Data Factory' instead of 'AWS Glue', 'Azure Databricks' instead of 'AWS EMR', 'AKS' instead of 'EKS'. OPTION 2: Remove Azure/GCP from skills since not actually used (creates requirement mismatch)."
}
```

---

### **DIMENSION 5: TODDLER TEST - BULLET ONE COMPLIANCE (0-10 points)**

**What to Check:**
Does the first bullet of BOTH Albertsons AND ValueLabs experience pass the "10-year-old could understand" test?

**Absolutely Forbidden in Bullet 1:**
- ❌ ANY technical terms: API, microservice, pipeline, architecture, backend, frontend, infrastructure, ETL, database, framework, algorithm, Python, Java, SQL, AWS, Azure, Docker, TensorFlow, SQL, Kubernetes
- ❌ ANY metrics: percentages, dollar amounts, numbers of any kind
- ❌ ANY jargon: optimization, scalability, latency, throughput, orchestration

**What IS Allowed in Bullet 1:**
- ✅ Business words: company, customers, shoppers, platform, system, team, stores
- ✅ Problem/outcome words: efficiency, errors, speed, quality, experience, cost
- ✅ Action words: built, created, helped, enabled, improved (without metrics)

**Perfect Example:**
"Built data systems that helped the company understand customer shopping patterns across online and in-store purchases, enabling personalized product recommendations for millions of weekly shoppers."

**Failure Example:**
"Built backend APIs using Python and FastAPI for microservices architecture processing 2TB daily with 99.9% uptime." (Contains: backend, APIs, Python, FastAPI, microservices, 2TB, 99.9%)

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **10 points:** BOTH first bullets (Albertsons + ValueLabs) are 100% jargon-free, tool-free, metric-free.
- **7-9 points:** One first bullet passes, the other has 1-2 forbidden terms.
- **4-6 points:** Both first bullets contain 1-3 forbidden terms each.
- **0-3 points:** Both first bullets are full of jargon, tools, and metrics.

---

### **DIMENSION 6: METRIC REALISM & VARIANCE (0-10 points)**

**What to Check:**
Are metrics realistic for 20 months tenure AND are there ZERO duplicate percentages/amounts anywhere in the resume?

**Part A: Realistic Metrics for 20 Months:**
- Cost savings: $50K - $200K annually (NOT $500K+ which needs years)
- Performance improvements: 20% - 60% (NOT 80%+ which is unrealistic for this tenure)
- Speed improvements: 2x - 5x faster (NOT 10x+ unless extraordinary)
- Error reduction: 60% - 95% (achievable with automation and iteration)
- Scale: Millions of customers, terabytes of data, thousands of stores

**Part B: AI DETECTION - DUPLICATE METRIC CHECK (CRITICAL)**

**MANDATORY VALIDATION PROCESS:**
1. Extract EVERY percentage from the entire resume (summary + experience + projects)
2. Extract EVERY dollar amount from the entire resume
3. Check if ANY number appears more than once

**AUTOMATIC SCORE REDUCTION:**
- 0 duplicates = No penalty
- 1 duplicate = Deduct 2 points
- 2 duplicates = Deduct 4 points
- 3+ duplicates = Deduct 5 points (set score to maximum 5/10)

**Examples of Duplicates to Catch:**
```json
{
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "dimension": "metric_realism",
  "location": "Summary + Albertsons Bullet 2",
  "issue": "Percentage 27% appears twice - exact duplicate (AI detection signature)",
  "example": "Summary: 'Improved product recommendation accuracy by 27%' AND Bullet 2: 'Customer 360 analytics platform achieved 27% improvement in product recommendation accuracy'",
  "fix": "Change summary to use different irregular number: '29% improvement' or '26% improvement' or '31% improvement'"
}
```

**Part C: Round Number Detection:**
- ❌ Round numbers: 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 75%, 100%
- ❌ Round dollar amounts: $50K, $100K, $1M, $2M
- ✅ Irregular numbers: 23%, 27%, 34%, 41%, 47%, 58%, 67%, 73%
- ✅ Specific ranges: "from 480ms to 310ms" vs just "35% reduction"

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **10 points:** All metrics realistic for 20 months + ZERO duplicates + all percentages irregular.
- **8 points:** All metrics realistic + 1 duplicate OR 1-2 round numbers.
- **6 points:** All metrics realistic + 2 duplicates OR 3+ round numbers.
- **5 points:** All metrics realistic + 3+ duplicates.
- **3-4 points:** 1 unrealistic metric + duplicates + round numbers.
- **0-2 points:** Multiple inflated metrics (e.g., $500K savings, 90% improvements in 20 months) + duplicates.

---

### **DIMENSION 7: TECHNOLOGY ERA COMPLIANCE (0-10 points)**

**What to Check:**
Does ValueLabs experience (May 2020 - July 2023) avoid anachronistic technologies?

**FORBIDDEN at ValueLabs (Didn't Exist 2020-2023):**
- ❌ GPT-3.5, GPT-4, ChatGPT, Claude, any LLM names
- ❌ LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGPT, any LLM frameworks
- ❌ RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- ❌ Vector databases: Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate, Qdrant
- ❌ "Prompt engineering" as a skill
- ❌ "AI Agents" or "Agentic AI"

**ALLOWED at ValueLabs (Existed 2020-2023):**
- ✅ Classical ML: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- ✅ Deep Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
- ✅ Pre-LLM NLP: BERT, Word2Vec, spaCy, NLTK, transformers library
- ✅ Traditional tools: Python, Java, SQL, AWS, Docker, Spark, Kafka

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **10 points:** Zero anachronistic technologies in ValueLabs section.
- **7-9 points:** 1 borderline mention (e.g., "transformers" which existed but was early).
- **4-6 points:** 2-3 clear anachronisms like "RAG" or "vector database".
- **0-3 points:** Multiple LLM/GPT mentions in 2020-2023 experience (destroys credibility).

---

### **DIMENSION 8: COLLABORATION LANGUAGE (0-10 points)**

**What to Check:**
Does the resume use appropriate ownership language for 20 months tenure?

**Acceptable for 20 Months:**
- ✅ "Led development of [system]" (reasonable for this tenure)
- ✅ "Architected [component] that achieved [result]" (acceptable with 20 months)
- ✅ "Built [system] that enabled [outcome]" (appropriate)
- ✅ "Platform achieved [result] through [implementation]" (system-focused, always good)
- ✅ "Contributed to [initiative] by [work]" (collaborative, always appropriate)

**Still Forbidden (Even at 20 Months):**
- ❌ "Single-handedly architected entire platform from scratch"
- ❌ "Independently built complete system with zero help"
- ❌ "Solely responsible for all development across company"

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **10 points:** Language shows appropriate ownership for 20 months. Mix of leading/building with collaborative framing.
- **7-9 points:** 1 bullet slightly over-claims but generally believable.
- **4-6 points:** 2-3 bullets claim unrealistic solo achievement.
- **0-3 points:** Multiple "single-handedly built everything alone" claims.

---

### **DIMENSION 9: PROJECT TIMELINE ACCURACY (0-10 points)**

**What to Check:**
Do projects align with MS program timeline and avoid overlap with full-time work?

**MS Program:** Aug 2023 - May 2025
**Full-time Albertsons:** May 2024 - Present

**ACCEPTABLE Project Timelines:**
- ✅ Project 1: Aug 2023 - Dec 2023 (Fall semester, before Albertsons)
- ✅ Project 2: Jan 2024 - **Apr 2024** (Spring semester, ends BEFORE Albertsons)
- ✅ Summer projects: Jun 2023 - Aug 2023 (before MS program starts)

**PROBLEMATIC Timelines (Deduct Points):**
- ⚠️ Project 2: Jan 2024 - May 2024 (ends same month Albertsons starts) → **Deduct 1 point**
- ❌ Any dates in 2025 or 2026 (future dates) → **Deduct 3 points**
- ❌ Project overlaps with Albertsons work (May 2024+) → **Deduct 5 points**

**Auto-Fail Triggers:**
- Project dated "Jun 2024 - Dec 2024" (during full-time Albertsons work) → Set score to 0
- Project dated "Jan 2025 - May 2025" (future work not yet done) → Set score to 0

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **10 points:** Both projects within MS timeline, end by Apr 2024, zero overlap with Albertsons.
- **9 points:** Minor issue - Project 2 ends May 2024 (same month Albertsons starts).
- **7-8 points:** 1 project has questionable timeline but not impossible.
- **4-6 points:** Timelines raise red flags about when work was actually done.
- **0-3 points:** Projects clearly dated during full-time work or in future.

---

### **DIMENSION 10: SKILLS SECTION AUTHENTICITY (0-10 points)**

**What to Check:**
Does every skill listed have a legitimate source (professional experience, academic coursework, or self-study)?

**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING: THREE LEGITIMATE SKILL SOURCES**
1. **Professional experience** (appears in bullets)
2. **Academic coursework** (learned in MS/undergrad programs)
3. **Self-study / certifications**

**What IS Valid (Education-Based Skills):**
- ✅ R learned in grad school statistics courses (even if not using professionally)
- ✅ Docker/Kubernetes studied in MLOps courses (even if not in production yet)
- ✅ PyTorch from ML courses (even if only TensorFlow used professionally)
- ✅ Statsmodels from statistics courses
- ✅ Git (assumed skill for any technical role, doesn't need explicit bullet mention)
- ✅ Maven/Hibernate from Java courses
- ✅ PostgreSQL learned in database courses (even if not in production yet)
- ✅ Bash from systems programming courses
- ✅ CI/CD concepts from software engineering courses
- ✅ Jupyter notebooks (standard data science tool, doesn't need bullet mention)

**What IS Keyword Stuffing:**
- ❌ Skills completely irrelevant to field (Photoshop for data scientist, Salesforce for software engineer)
- ❌ Technologies with zero exposure (Blockchain if never studied, Mandarin if don't speak)
- ❌ Tools added purely for keyword matching with no learning path
- ❌ Mobile development (Swift, Kotlin) for backend/data roles with no connection

**VALIDATION QUESTION:** Can the candidate explain WHERE they learned this skill?
- **If YES** (education, past job, self-study, certification) → **Valid skill**
- **If NO** (added purely for keyword matching) → **Keyword stuffing**

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **10 points:** All skills have valid source (education/experience/self-study). Zero keyword stuffing.
- **9 points:** 1-2 skills borderline but could be explained as education-based.
- **7 points:** 3-5 skills questionable but might have weak justification.
- **5 points:** 6-8 skills appear to be keyword stuffing.
- **3 points:** 9-10 skills are clear keyword stuffing.
- **0 points:** 11+ skills are keyword stuffing (40%+ of skills section).

**Example of Valid Education-Based Skills (NOT Keyword Stuffing):**
```json
{
  "severity": "LOW",
  "dimension": "skills_authenticity",
  "location": "Skills Section - Education-Based Skills",
  "issue": "11 skills listed but not explicitly mentioned in bullets. However, ALL can be explained as legitimate education-based skills: R (grad school statistics), PyTorch (ML courses), Docker/Kubernetes (MLOps studies), Git (assumed version control), PostgreSQL (database courses), Bash (systems programming), Maven/Hibernate (Java courses), CI/CD (software engineering), Jupyter (data science standard).",
  "example": "R, PyTorch, Statsmodels, Docker, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, Git, CI/CD, Jupyter, Bash, Maven",
  "fix": "These are LEGITIMATE education-based skills. Candidate can explain in interview: 'I learned R in my MS Data Science program', 'Familiar with Docker from MLOps coursework', 'Used Git throughout education'. This is NOT keyword stuffing. Score: 9/10 (minor deduction for breadth, not fraud)."
}
```

**Example of Actual Keyword Stuffing:**
```json
{
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "dimension": "skills_authenticity",
  "location": "Skills Section",
  "issue": "5 skills are clear keyword stuffing - completely irrelevant to data science field and no plausible learning path.",
  "example": "Adobe Photoshop, Salesforce CRM, Swift, Kotlin, Blockchain - none have any connection to data science role, no education/experience justification possible",
  "fix": "DELETE these 5 skills immediately. They are completely irrelevant to the role and cannot be explained in interviews. This is pure keyword stuffing."
}
```

## LATEX FORMATTING VALIDATION

**Check for Correct Bolding:**
- ✅ Metrics bolded: `\textbf{34\%}`, `\textbf{\$47K}`, `\textbf{2TB}`, `\textbf{8M}`
- ❌ Tools bolded: `\textbf{Python}`, `\textbf{AWS}` (STRICTLY FORBIDDEN - should NOT be bolded)
- ❌ Verbs bolded: `\textbf{Optimized}` (STRICTLY FORBIDDEN - should NOT be bolded)

**Check for Special Character Escaping:**
- ✅ `\%` for percent, `\$` for dollar, `\&` for ampersand
- ❌ Raw `%`, `$`, `&` characters (will break LaTeX compilation)

**Deduct 2 points from total score if:**
- 3+ instances of incorrectly bolded tools/verbs
- 3+ instances of unescaped special characters

}
```

---

## SCORING LOGIC

**Pass Threshold:** 80 points out of 100

**Verdict Determination:**
- **PASS:** Score >= 80 AND zero critical failures AND zero CRITICAL severity issues
- **FAIL:** Score < 80 OR any critical failure OR any CRITICAL severity issue

**Recommendation Logic:**
- If verdict = PASS → `"recommendation": "APPROVE_FOR_SUBMISSION"`
- If verdict = FAIL → `"recommendation": "SEND_TO_DEEPSEEK_FOR_REVISION"`

---

## CRITICAL FAILURE AUTO-FAIL CONDITIONS

If ANY of these are detected, immediately set verdict to FAIL regardless of score:

1. **Impossible Business Claims:** Clinical trials, gene sequencing, satellite systems at Albertsons
2. **External Product Claims:** SaaS platform sold to 500 clients, API marketplace, licensed CRM
3. **Anachronistic Technology:** GPT-4, LangChain, RAG in 2020-2023 ValueLabs experience
4. **Timeline Violations:** Projects dated in 2025-2026 or significant overlap with full-time work
5. **Credential Fabrication:** Claimed work at departments that don't exist at Albertsons

---

## EVALUATION PRINCIPLES

**Be Ruthlessly Objective:** This resume will be read by Albertsons HR and hiring managers who know their own company. Any fabrication or impossibility will instantly disqualify the candidate.

**Prioritize Authenticity Over Keyword Matching:** A resume with 95% JD keyword match but impossible claims is worthless. A resume with 85% match but 100% believable is gold.

**Think Like a Skeptical Recruiter:** Ask yourself: "If I worked at Albertsons, would I believe this person actually did this work in our company?" If the answer is no, mark it as an issue.

**Context Matters:** A 20-month tenure allows for reasonable ownership claims like "led development" or "architected component", but still avoid unrealistic solo hero language like "single-handedly built entire platform."

**Education-Based Skills Are Valid:** If a skill can be explained as learned in formal education, self-study, or certification, it is NOT keyword stuffing. Only penalize skills with zero learning path and no connection to the field.

---

## FINAL INSTRUCTION

Evaluate the resume with extreme rigor. The goal is to catch every credibility issue BEFORE it reaches human reviewers. Better to be rejected by this automated evaluation than to be rejected by a real recruiter who knows Albertsons doesn't do clinical trials.

Return ONLY the JSON output. No explanations, no preambles, no markdown formatting. Just the pure JSON object.
